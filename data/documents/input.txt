Procedure Description

After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the EP lab in a fasting and post-absorptive state. The patient was
prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. MAC anesthesia was used for sedation. One percent Lidocaine was given in the nght
groin. A 8 Fr and 2 6 Fr sheaths were placed in the right femoral vein using a needle. a 5 Fr sheath was placed in the right SFA.
Through the 8 Fr sheath, a DecaNav catheter was advanced using 3d CARTO mapping to minimize fluroscopy. The IVC was

mapped and the RA was mapped with the CS and His labelled on the 3d map. A deflectable CS catheter and a quad polar catheter
were advanced under CARTO guidance to the CS, His, and the ablation cather was placed in the RA. RA pacing was performed
and the mapping catheter was then advanced into the RV. Sinus node function was normal. RV pacing was performed with
concentric, decrimental conduction . CS pacing with atrial extrastimuli testing revealed no evidence of dual AV node physiology.
With rapid atrial pacing PR>RR was seen.

The his catheter was advanced to the RV apex and the steerable quad was advanced to RVOT. EPS was undertaken with tightly
coupled S3 from RVOT and RVapex and no VT could be induced. lsoprel was started @ 3-4 mcg/ming and EPS was repeated. No
VT could be induced.

The steerable catheter was then introduced retrograde across the Aortic Valve and LV pacing was performed with tightly coupled
S3 and no Vt could be induced.

\Soprel was stopped

After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the cath lab . Using maximal sterile technique, the left anterior
chest wall was prepped in the usual fashion. Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine was applied in the 3rd-4th intercostal space. A
Subcutaneous incision was then done and a Medtronic Loop recorder was then inserted without difficulty or complication. Steri-
strips were placed and the site was bandaged. Adequate hemostasis. EBL < 10 cc. No immediate complications.

The study was deemed complete. All catheters were removed and all sheaths were flushed. The patient was then transferred to
recovery in stable condition to have sheaths removed with manual occlusive pressure. No immediate complications appreciated. A
limited echocardiogram to evaluate for pericardial effusion has been ordered Routine post-procedural care has been initiated.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Marilyn is a very nice 92 y.o. woman with a history of A fib (s/p ablations and cardioversion's, on
Coumadin), left breast cancer (s/p mastectomy in 1983 followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF),
and back melanoma (s/p resection) who was originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy from 9/20/12.
Patient was initially treated with radiation to the left upper lung by Dr. Farley Yang but it apparently
recurred locally and patient was treated with a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that revealed a 1.5 cm
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with pleural involvement that was positive for EGFR.

The patient was found on CT guided biopsy of a right upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a
recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was EGFR exon 19 deletion positive and the
patient was seen at Ironwood Cancer Center by Dr. Lesley Klein who recommended treatment with
Afatinib for suspected metastatic recurrence in the right upper lung and left lower lung. Patient was treated
with antibiotics with resolution of the left lower lung ground glass nodules with the right upper lung mass
staying stable at 1.2 cm and no mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen. Patient did undergo definitive
stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. patient was last seen by me at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and
then re-established care at this practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Patient
presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to HH Thompson Peak from 1/9/22 to 1/15/22 for community acquired
pneumonia and tested negative for Covid. She was treated with IV antibiotics that she completed she was
also found to have Afib with RVR and was placed on IV diltiazem and given lasix and continued on
Coumadin. A CT angio of the chest was negative for a PE and only showed bilateral pneumonia.

The patient was seen at HonorHealth Thompson Peak on 11/15/202 after suffering a fall. CT of the
C/T/L spine/HEAD were negative. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was negative aside from
atelectasis in the right upper lung lobe and a small renal cyst at the midpole. An X-ray of the chest showed
atelectasis in the right upper lobe and nodularity in the left upper lobe was unchanged. Patient was
ambulating with a walker and was discharged later that day and was advised to follow up with her PCP.
She presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to the hospital on 02/08/2024 for fall out of her shower chair with head trauma
and loss of consciousness. Hematomas and CT of the brain showed a small hemorrhage. Patient was
stable and discharged home on 02/10/2024. Patient presents for follow-up.

She has not had any further falls. She reports ongoing easy bruising. The patient denies current
shortness of breath. The patient denies any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. The patient denies
any lymphadenopathy or recent or frequent infections. The patient has not had any nosebleeds, gum
bleeds, coffee ground emesis, black or bloody stools. The patient reports neuropathy in her legs. The
patient reports chronic diarrhea. She denies constipation or abdominal pain. Her and her husband would

IMAGING:

CT chest 02/13/2024: . Bandlike right upper lobe atelectasis/fibrosis, parenchymal scarring and
bronchiectatic change, similar to the prior exam and likely related to prior radiation therapy. Previous left
upper lobectomy. Stable right upper lobe groundglass opacity, likely inflammatory. Slightly larger pleural-
based right middle lobe nodule which may still be inflammatory. Associated groundglass opacity is also
again seen. Continued follow-up is recommended.

CT chest 10/03/2023: Right upper lobe bandlike scarring/atelectasis with bronchiectasis, unchanged and
likely postradiation related. Right middle lobe pleural-based nodule measuring 10 mm with adjacent
groundglass opacity, grossly unchanged from 06/16/2023 and 06/23/2023. Right upper lobe groundglass
opacity measuring 16 mm, unchanged. Additional findings as noted.

PET-CT 06/23/2023: Diminished volume and FDG uptake intensity of treated neoplasm and radiation
fibrosis in the right upper lobe, suggesting good local disease control. Previously described new right
middle lobe pulmonary nodule moderately hypermetabolic with PET, suspicious although not definitive for
malignancy, either metastatic or metachronous primary; consider CT-guided percutaneous biopsy for
definitive tissue diagnosis. Additional groundglass density lesions in the apical right upper lobe
demonstrating only low-level FDG uptake, continued imaging observation appropriate. No other definite
lymphatic or hematogenous metastases.

CT chest 06/16/2023: Stable right upper lobe parenchymal density consistent with radiation change.
Ground-glass density in the right apex is stable. New right middle lobe peripheral pleural-based nodule
measuring 1.4 cm. This is indeterminate. Suggest further evaluation with PET scan. Other small nodules

are stable. Other findings: Right chest wall elastofibroma, calcified coronary arteries, right renal artery
aneurysm, calcified hepatic granuloma, right renal artery cysts. Cardiomegaly. Left upper lobe lobectomy
with hyperexpansion of the left lung with scattered parenchymal scarring.

Right rib and chest x-ray 03/29/2023: Subacute appearing fracture in the anterior lateral aspect right 7th
rib. The remainder of the study appears similar to previous studies.

CT chest 9/20/2022: No metastasis detected. Stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5 mm 4 x 4 mm right lung apex
groundglass nodules without solid nidus, likely representing adenomatous hyperplasia spectrum lesions
(previously known as BAC). Moderate multi-chamber cardiomegaly. Moderately calcified mitral and aortic
valve annulus. Moderately calcified left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery
atherosclerosis. Mildly tortuous moderately calcified thoracic aorta is commonly seen with systemic
hypertension. 10 mm diameter peripherally calcified distal right renal artery aneurysm, stable compared
with 05/19/2020. No leak.

CT chest 3/23/22: Evolution of previously seen airspace opacities in the left lower lobe compatible with
resolved pneumonia. Stable changes from left upper lobectomy and postradiation fibrosis to the right
upper lobe measuring 3 cm. 6 and 8 mm right upper lobe groundglass nodules are stable.

CTA chest 1/9/22: No CT angiographic evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.Cardiomegaly.
Mediastinal adenopathy, mild. Left perihilar airspace disease and groundglass opacity suspicious for
pneumonia. Subsegmental airspace disease in the right upper lobe also likely reflects pneumonia.
Groundglass nodules present in the right middle lobe measuring up to 12 mm diameter. These are
indeterminate with respect to their inflammatory versus neoplastic etiology in the setting of prior
malignancy.

CT chest 10/1/2021: No evidence of metastatic disease. Stable solid and ground-glass nodules in the
right apex. Stable right upper lobe oblong density consistent with the patient's known non-small cell lung
cancer. There is some surrounding interstitial densities compatible post radiation change.

CT chest 5/19/20: Gradually decreasing size of the mass like consolidation in the right upper lobe which
likely reflects post radiation changes. The once visualized tumor in the right upper lobe remain obscured.
Stable right apical 7 mm semisolid nodule. Postsurgical change from partial left upper lobectomy. No new
pulmonary nodule or infiltrate. Bi-atrial enlargement and coronary artery consolidation. Non obstructing 5
mm right renal stone.

ASSESSMENTIPLAN:

1. Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer: Stage I[A2(T1bNOMO) vs stage IV (T1a,NO,M1), isolated
metastatic recurrence to the right upper lung. Diagnosed on CT guided right upper lung biopsy of a right
upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was
positive for EGFR exon 19 deletion (EML4/ALK was negative and PDL1 was less than 1%). The patient
did apparently have a PET/CT on 9/7/17 that showed a ground glass nodule in the right upper lung
measuring 1.3 cm with an SUV of 1.5 and an area of atelectasis in the right lower lung. A CT chest from
2/26/18 showed a decrease in the biopsy proven right upper lung ground glass nodule and a new ground
glass nodule in the left lower lung that measured 9 x 11 mm and some mediastinal lymph nodes that were
less than 1 cm in size. Patient was treated with antibiotics and a follow up CT chest from 5/16/18 showed
resolution of the left lower lung nodule and lymphadenopathy.

Patient did undergo definitive stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. CT chest from 12/28/18
showed a significant change in the right apical nodule that was treated with radiation where it had
increased in size from 1.2 cm up to 4 x 3.6 cm and is now showing some consolidation in this area that
may be due to post radiation treatment. | did speak to Dr. Jerry Lucas about the CT scan who did feel this
was more likely due to be post radiation changes. Given that is had rapidly increased in size on CT scan
from 8/16/18 to CT from 12/28/18, | did obtain a PET/CT on 1/28/19 that showed the prior right upper lung
ground glass opacity was obscured by a larger parenchymal opacity in the right upper lung with SUV 3.4
(previously 1.5) that was most suggestive of inflammation rather than recurrent malignancy. No evidence
of metastatic disease.

Patient was see at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and then re-established care at my current
practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Brain MRI from 2020 showed no
evidence of metastatic disease. CT of the chest without contrast from 9/20/2022 showed stable 5 x 5 mm,
6x5 mm, 4 x 4 mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing
adenomatous hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only

Scott, Marilyn (MRN 3222035) Printed by Katherine Stevens [145643] at 8/27/2024 8:46 AM 10/207

8/27/24, 8:46 AM Scott, Marilyn (MRN: 3222035) DOB: 9/6/1931

mentioned atelectasis in the right upper lung. Patient's last CEA from 3/5/2024 is stable but elevated at
6.0. CT of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET/CT from 06/23/2023
does show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic
or metachronous primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation
from 07/10/2023 to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert.

Her last CT of the chest from 02/13/2024 showed a slight increase in size in the right middle lobe
nodule which may still be inflammatory. | had planned on checking a CT of the chest in 07/2024, however
patient and her husband would like to delay this due to increasing difficulty with mobility and driving. We
will rediscuss completing the CT in 12 weeks.

2. Original left upper lung non small cell carcinoma: Originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy on 8/20/12.
Patient was apparently treated with radiation to this area by Dr. Farley Yang with a local recurrence.
Patient then underwent a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that showed a 1.5 cm mass with involvement of
the pleural that measured 1.5 cm and was positive for EGFR.

Patient had a CT of the chest without contrast on 9/20/2022 showed stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5 mm, 4
x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous
hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned atelectasis in
the right upper lung. Patient's last CEA from 08/18/2023 continues to mildly elevated but stable at 4.1. CT
of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET/CT from 06/23/2023 does
show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic or
metachronous primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation
from 07/10/2023 to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert.

Last CT of the chest from 02/13/2024 slow to slightly larger right middle lobe nodule that may be
inflammatory. | had planned on checking a CT of the chest in 07/2024, however patient and her husband
would like to delay this due to increasing difficulty with mobility and driving. We will rediscuss completing
the CT in 12 weeks.

3. Left breast cancer: S/p radical left mastectomy and simple right prophylactic mastectomy in 1983.
Patient was treated with adjuvant CMF.

4. Melanoma on back: S/p resection. Patient's last skin check from 06/2023 and was negative for any
melanoma recurrences but patient did have a Mohs procedure for a squamous cell carcinoma. Repeat
skin check in 01/2024 did show some type of cancer to her right lower extremity and she is receiving
monthly chemo injections for 3 months.

5. Basal cell carcinoma: S/p resection in 10/2023. Patient's skin check in 06/2023 and she had a
squamous cell carcinoma from her left eye to her lip that was removed with a Mohs with Dr. Lykins. Repeat
skin check in 01/2024 did show some type of cancer to her right lower extremity and she received 3
monthly chemo injections.

6. Right anterior rib pain: Resolved. Patient has right rib pain that has persisted since Monday after having
an esophagram done. Right rib x-ray from 03/29/2023 did show a subacute fracture of the right 7th rib.

7. Shortness of breath: Occurred yesterday prior to going to bed. Resolved after coughing up mucous.
She has not had any shortness of breath today. If she has any bouts of recurrent shortness of breath, she
is to go to the ER.

8. Normocytic anemia: Labs from 06/10/2024 show mildly low hemoglobin at 11.7 with a normal MCV. |
will check iron studies.

DISPOSITION: The patient will return to see Dr. Bibb in 12 weeks via phone visit. Labs (CBC, CMP, CEA)
will be drawn one week prior to each visit via mobile lab.

The patient was discussed with Dr. John Bibb who agrees with the assessment and plan.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your patient's care. Please feel free to contact me if any
questions or concerns arise.

1- Perm Atrial Fib

2- Continue coumadin for now

3- reasonable candidiate for Watchman

4- | explained to the patient and family all the technical aspects of the procedures and all the risks
involved from vascular access injury injury to the cardiac structures upon transseptal puncture or upon
deployment stroke contrast induced nephropathy the need for emergent open heart surgery for life-saving
measures device dislodgement and the need for percutaneous retrieval versus open surgical retrieval and
even death. They verbalized understanding and wished to proceed they also understand the need for
multiple transesophageal echocardiograms before the procedure, during the procedure, 6 weeks, 6
months and 1 year for surveillance and also the need for continuation of anticoagulation uninterrupted for
6 weeks after device implantation and dual anti-platelet therapy until the 6 months TEE.

5-I told her at this point with her significant risk of falling with possible bleeding and deadly consequences
continuing anticoagulation might not be a good option at this point and she has to make her final decision
with the to proceed with Watchman or stop anticoagulation and continue to have a risk of stroke

We will contact her next week for final decision

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Marilyn is a very nice 92 y.o. woman with a history of A fib (s/p ablations and cardioversion's, on
Coumadin), left breast cancer (s/p mastectomy in 1983 followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF),
and back melanoma (s/p resection) who was originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy from 9/20/12.
Patient was initially treated with radiation to the left upper lung by Dr. Farley Yang but it apparently
recurred locally and patient was treated with a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that revealed a 1.5 cm
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with pleural involvement that was positive for EGFR.

The patient was found on CT guided biopsy of a right upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a
recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was EGFR exon 19 deletion positive and the
patient was seen at Ironwood Cancer Center by Dr. Lesley Klein who recommended treatment with
Afatinib for suspected metastatic recurrence in the right upper lung and left lower lung. Patient was treated
with antibiotics with resolution of the left lower lung ground glass nodules with the right upper lung mass
staying stable at 1.2 cm and no mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen. Patient did undergo definitive
stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. patient was last seen by me at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and
then re-established care at this practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Patient
presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to HH Thompson Peak from 1/9/22 to 1/15/22 for community acquired
pneumonia and tested negative for Covid. She was treated with IV antibiotics that she completed she was
also found to have Afib with RVR and was placed on IV diltiazem and given lasix and continued on
Coumadin. A CT angio of the chest was negative for a PE and only showed bilateral pneumonia.

The patient was seen at HonorHealth Thompson Peak on 11/15/202 after suffering a fall. CT of the
C/T/L spine/HEAD were negative. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was negative aside from
atelectasis in the right upper lung lobe and a small renal cyst at the midpole. An X-ray of the chest showed
atelectasis in the right upper lobe and nodularity in the left upper lobe was unchanged. Patient was
ambulating with a walker and was discharged later that day and was advised to follow up with her PCP.
She presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to the hospital on 02/08/2024 for fall out of her shower chair with head trauma
and loss of consciousness. Hematomas and CT of the brain showed a small hemorrhage. Patient was
stable and discharged home on 02/10/2024. Patient presents for follow-up.

She has not had any further falls. She reports she was some type of skin cancer on her right lower
extremity and is receiving monthly chemotherapy injections for 3 months. The patient denies current
shortness of breath. The patient denies any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. The patient denies
any lymphadenopathy or recent or frequent infections. The patient has not had any nosebleeds, gum
bleeds, coffee ground emesis, black or bloody stools. The patient reports neuropathy in her legs. The

IMAGING:

CT chest 02/13/2024: . Bandlike right upper lobe atelectasis/fibrosis, parenchymal scarring and
bronchiectatic change, similar to the prior exam and likely related to prior radiation therapy. Previous left
upper lobectomy. Stable right upper lobe groundglass opacity, likely inflammatory. Slightly larger pleural-
based right middle lobe nodule which may still be inflammatory. Associated groundglass opacity is also
again seen. Continued follow-up is recommended.

CT chest 10/03/2023: Right upper lobe bandlike scarring/atelectasis with bronchiectasis, unchanged and
likely postradiation related. Right middle lobe pleural-based nodule measuring 10 mm with adjacent
groundglass opacity, grossly unchanged from 06/16/2023 and 06/23/2023. Right upper lobe groundglass
opacity measuring 16 mm, unchanged. Additional findings as noted.

PET-CT 06/23/2023: Diminished volume and FDG uptake intensity of treated neoplasm and radiation
fibrosis in the right upper lobe, suggesting good local disease control. Previously described new right
middle lobe pulmonary nodule moderately hypermetabolic with PET, suspicious although not definitive for
malignancy, either metastatic or metachronous primary; consider CT-guided percutaneous biopsy for
definitive tissue diagnosis. Additional groundglass density lesions in the apical right upper lobe
demonstrating only low-level FDG uptake, continued imaging observation appropriate. No other definite
lymphatic or hematogenous metastases.

CT chest 06/16/2023: Stable right upper lobe parenchymal density consistent with radiation change.
Ground-glass density in the right apex is stable. New right middle lobe peripheral pleural-based nodule
measuring 1.4 cm. This is indeterminate. Suggest further evaluation with PET scan. Other small nodules
are stable. Other findings: Right chest wall elastofibroma, calcified coronary arteries, right renal artery
aneurysm, calcified hepatic granuloma, right renal artery cysts. Cardiomegaly. Left upper lobe lobectomy
with hyperexpansion of the left lung with scattered parenchymal scarring.

Right rib and chest x-ray 03/29/2023: Subacute appearing fracture in the anterior lateral aspect right 7th
rib. The remainder of the study appears similar to previous studies.

8/27/24, 8:46 AM Scott, Marilyn (MRN: 3222035) DOB: 9/6/1931

CT chest 9/20/2022: No metastasis detected. Stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5 mm 4 x 4 mm right lung apex
groundglass nodules without solid nidus, likely representing adenomatous hyperplasia spectrum lesions
(previously known as BAC). Moderate multi-chamber cardiomegaly. Moderately calcified mitral and aortic
valve annulus. Moderately calcified left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery
atherosclerosis. Mildly tortuous moderately calcified thoracic aorta is commonly seen with systemic
hypertension. 10 mm diameter peripherally calcified distal right renal artery aneurysm, stable compared
with 05/19/2020. No leak.

CT chest 3/23/22: Evolution of previously seen airspace opacities in the left lower lobe compatible with
resolved pneumonia. Stable changes from left upper lobectomy and postradiation fibrosis to the right
upper lobe measuring 3 cm. 6 and 8 mm right upper lobe groundglass nodules are stable.

CTA chest 1/9/22: No CT angiographic evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.Cardiomegaly.
Mediastinal adenopathy, mild. Left perihilar airspace disease and groundglass opacity suspicious for
pneumonia. Subsegmental airspace disease in the right upper lobe also likely reflects pneumonia.
Groundglass nodules present in the right middle lobe measuring up to 12 mm diameter. These are
indeterminate with respect to their inflammatory versus neoplastic etiology in the setting of prior
malignancy.

CT chest 10/1/2021: No evidence of metastatic disease. Stable solid and ground-glass nodules in the
right apex. Stable right upper lobe oblong density consistent with the patient's known non-small cell lung
cancer. There is some surrounding interstitial densities compatible post radiation change.

CT chest 5/19/20: Gradually decreasing size of the mass like consolidation in the right upper lobe which
likely reflects post radiation changes. The once visualized tumor in the right upper lobe remain obscured.
Stable right apical 7 mm semisolid nodule. Postsurgical change from partial left upper lobectomy. No new
pulmonary nodule or infiltrate. Bi-atrial enlargement and coronary artery consolidation. Non obstructing 5
mm right renal stone.

ASSESSMENTI/PLAN:

1. Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer: Stage IA2(T1bNOMO) vs stage IV (T1a,NO,M1), isolated
metastatic recurrence to the right upper lung. Diagnosed on CT guided right upper lung biopsy of a right
upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was
positive for EGFR exon 19 deletion (EML4/ALK was negative and PDL1 was less than 1%). The patient
did apparently have a PET/CT on 9/7/17 that showed a ground glass nodule in the right upper lung
measuring 1.3 cm with an SUV of 1.5 and an area of atelectasis in the right lower lung. A CT chest from
2/26/18 showed a decrease in the biopsy proven right upper lung ground glass nodule and a new ground
glass nodule in the left lower lung that measured 9 x 11 mm and some mediastinal lymph nodes that were
less than 1 cm in size. Patient was treated with antibiotics and a follow up CT chest from 5/16/18 showed
resolution of the left lower lung nodule and lymphadenopathy.

Patient did undergo definitive stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. CT chest from 12/28/18
showed a significant change in the right apical nodule that was treated with radiation where it had
increased in size from 1.2 cm up to 4 x 3.6 cm and is now showing some consolidation in this area that
may be due to post radiation treatment. | did speak to Dr. Jerry Lucas about the CT scan who did feel this
was more likely due to be post radiation changes. Given that is had rapidly increased in size on CT scan
from 8/16/18 to CT from 12/28/18, | did obtain a PET/CT on 1/28/19 that showed the prior right upper lung
ground glass opacity was obscured by a larger parenchymal opacity in the right upper lung with SUV 3.4
(previously 1.5) that was most suggestive of inflammation rather than recurrent malignancy. No evidence
of metastatic disease.

Patient was see at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and then re-established care at my current
practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Brain MRI from 2020 showed no
evidence of metastatic disease. CT of the chest without contrast from 9/20/2022 showed stable 5 x 5 mm,
6x 5mm, 4 x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing
adenomatous hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only
mentioned atelectasis in the right upper lung. Patient's last CEA from 3/5/2024 is stable but elevated at
6.0. CT of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET/CT from 06/23/2023
does show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic
or metachronous primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation
from 07/10/2023 to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert.

Her last CT of the chest from 02/13/2024 showed a slight increase in size in the right middle lobe

nodule which may still be inflammatory. | will check a CT of the chest in 07/2024.

2. Original left upper lung non small cell carcinoma: Originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy on 8/20/12.
Patient was apparently treated with radiation to this area by Dr. Farley Yang with a local recurrence.
Patient then underwent a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that showed a 1.5 cm mass with involvement of
the pleural that measured 1.5 cm and was positive for EGFR.

Patient had a CT of the chest without contrast on 9/20/2022 showed stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5 mm, 4
x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous
hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned atelectasis in
the right upper lung. Patient's last CEA from 08/18/2023 continues to mildly elevated but stable at 4.1. CT
of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET/CT from 06/23/2023 does
show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic or
metachronous primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation
from 07/10/2023 to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert.

Last CT of the chest from 02/13/2024 slow to slightly larger right middle lobe nodule that may be
inflammatory. | will check a CT of the chest in 7/2024.

3. Left breast cancer: S/p radical left mastectomy and simple right prophylactic mastectomy in 1983.
Patient was treated with adjuvant CMF.

4. Melanoma on back: S/p resection. Patient's last skin check from 06/2023 and was negative for any
melanoma recurrences but patient did have a Mohs procedure for a squamous cell carcinoma. Repeat
skin check in 01/2024 did show some type of cancer to her right lower extremity and she is receiving
monthly chemo injections for 3 months.

5. Basal cell carcinoma: S/p resection in 10/2023. Patient's last skin check was in 06/2023 and she had a
squamous cell carcinoma from her left eye to her lip that was removed with a Mohs with Dr. Lykins. Repeat
skin check in 01/2024 did show some type of cancer to her right lower extremity and she is receiving
monthly chemo injections for 3 months.

6. Right anterior rib pain: Resolved. Patient has right rib pain that has persisted since Monday after having
an esophagram done. Right rib x-ray from 03/29/2023 did show a subacute fracture of the right 7th rib.

7. Shortness of breath: Occurred yesterday prior to going to bed. Resolved after coughing up mucous.
She has not had any shortness of breath today. If she has any bouts of recurrent shortness of breath, she
is to go to the ER.

DISPOSITION: The patient will return to see Dr. Bibb on 6/10/2024. Labs (CBC, CMP, CEA) will be drawn
one week prior to each visit at PCP office.

Telephone visit: 15 minutes with greater than 50% of the time spent on counseling.
The patient was discussed with Dr. John Bibb who agrees with the assessment and plan.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your patient's care. Please feel free to contact me if any
questions or concerns arise.

Result Date: 2/10/2024

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST HISTORY: 92-year-old female with intracranial hemorrhage
COMPARISON: 02/09/2024 at 0723 hours TECHNIQUE: Axial images obtained through the head without
intravenous contrast. Automated exposure control, adjustment of mA and/or kV according to patient size,
or iterative reconstruction dose optimization techniques were used. FINDINGS: Hyperattenuated focus
again noted along the posterior septum pellucidum, unchanged. Persistent blood products layering in
bilateral posterior ventricular horns, unchanged. There is no extra-axial fluid. There is mild to moderate
bilateral periventricular and subcortical white matter hypoattenuation noted which is symmetric in
distribution. There is no CT evidence of acute ischemia. There is mild to moderate diffuse cerebral atrophy
with associated prominence of the ventricular system. There is no intracranial mass or mass effect.

Basilar cisterns are patent. The ventricles are normal. Intracranial vasculature is normal. The orbits are
normal. The mastoid air cells are normal. There is mild mucoperiosteal thickening of the paranasal
sinuses with complete opacification of the sphenoid sinuses.. There are no skull abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: 1. Hyperattenuated focus within the involving the posterior septum pellucidum with
associated intraventricular blood products layering in bilateral posterior horns, unchanged.. 2. Mild
bilateral periventricular and subcortical white matter chronic small vessel disease with age-appropriate
cerebral atrophy. 3. Chronic paranasal sinus disease JASON KERR 2/10/2024 1:59 AM

Assessment/Plan:
92 y/o female s/p GLF on Coumadin

Hemorrhage along septum pellucidum, occipital horns of lateral ventricles
Coagulopathy secondary to Coumadin

- CT brain stable this AM

- SBP < 140

- neurosurgery to sign off

- hold Coumadin x 14 days

- follow-up with Dr. Wanebo PRN

Patient has no direct neurosurgical contraindication to prophylactic dose anticoagulation at 71 hours post
stable CT brain from a neurosurgery standpoint. The risk of increasing intracranial hemorrhage remains
present. Ultimately this decision will be deferred to the attending trauma service. Patients and families
should be educated on these risks prior to starting anticoagulation by the trauma team.

Assessment:

Marilyn is a 92 y/o female who presents s/p GLF while attempting to sit on a stool in her bathroom to get
dressed. At baseline she is independent with her ADL's, majority of IADI's and uses a walker while in her
home. She reports her spouse having a shuffling gait and considering use of a walker.

Marilyn presents with generalized deconditioning, reports feeling near her baseline. Balance is improved
during ADL and fctl mobility training with use of FWW, requires cues to not leave walker prematurely
during ADL tasks as she attempts to do so multiple times. She requires grossly SBA for STS and CGA for
fctl mobility- has difficulty dual tasking so frequently stopping to talk during fctl mobility.

| anticipate Marilyn is not far from her functional baseline. Recommend 1-2 addtl IP OT sessions to
reinforce walker use with her ADL routine and ensure safe progression of her ADL and fctl mobility routine.
Rec d/c home with family once acute care needs are met and home health to complete home safety eval
and facilitate continued aging in place.

IMAGING:
CT Brain WO Contrast

Result Date: 2/9/2024

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST HISTORY: Ground level fall COMPARISON: CT of the brain from
2/8/2024, selected images from a PET/CT from June 23, 2023 TECHNIQUE: No contrast. Automatic
exposure control, adjustment of mA and/or kV according to patient size or iterative reconstruction dose
optimization techniques were used. FINDINGS: BRAIN: A5 mm hyperdense focus in the midline along
the septum pellucidum seen on series 2 image 40 is slightly larger than on 2/8/2024 (when it measured 3
mm) and is new compared to the PET/CT from June 23, 2023. This probably represents a trace amount of
hemorrhage. There is also a small amount of hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns of the lateral
ventricles, which is new compared to 2/8/2024. There is no extra-axial fluid collection or midline shift. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent, as seen previously, consistent with volume loss. There is mild
decreased density in the periventricular white matter, probably from previous small vessel ischemic
disease. CALVARIUM/SKULL BASE: No fracture or destructive lesion. Mastoids and middle ears are
clear. There is a small hematoma in the left aspect of the face, which is only partially imaged on this study.
PARANASAL SINUSES: There is complete opacification of the right sphenoid sinus, which is unchanged
and consistent with chronic sinusitis. There are postoperative changes in the paranasal sinuses. There is
trace mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and there is mild mucosal thickening in several
ethmoid air cells.

IMPRESSION: Small hyperdense focus along the septum pellucidum is slightly larger than previously and
probably represents a small amount of hemorrhage. There is a small amount of hemorrhage layering in the
occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, which is new since the CT from 2/8/2024 The report was called to
the patient's nurse at the time of interpretation. IRINA NISTOR 2/9/2024 8:53 AM

identified. OTHER SKELETAL: No acute rib fractures identified. Old healed fracture deformities of multiple
left ribs. ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: LIVER: Normal. BILIARY: Normal. PANCREAS: Normal. SPLEEN:
Normal. ADRENALS: Normal. URINARY TRACT: Kidneys show symmetric enhancement, without
hydronephrosis. There is a nonobstructing 7 mm calculus in the lower right kidney. AORTA/VASCULAR:
No abdominal aortic aneurysm. Severe aortoiliac atherosclerotic calcification. There is an 8 mm partially
rim calcified saccular aneurysm at the bifurcation of the main right renal artery. LYMPH NODES: No
adenopathy. PERITONEUM/ RETROPERITONEUM: Normal. BOWEL: Bowel is negative for obstruction or
inflammatory changes. Scattered colonic diverticula. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Normal. BODY WALL:
Normal. ADDITIONAL SOFT TISSUE FINDINGS: None LUMBAR SPINE: ALIGNMENT: Normal DISC
SPACES: Multilevel chronic degenerative changes. OTHER: No lumbar spine fracture identified. OTHER

Result Date: 2/8/2024

CT MAXILLOFACIAL WITHOUT CONTRAST HISTORY: Ground level fall, facial trauma COMPARISON:
CT brain from the same day TECHNIQUE: No contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
generated and reviewed. Automated exposure control, adjustment of mA and/or kV according to patient
size or iterative reconstruction dose optimization techniques were used. FINDINGS: There is a mostly ill-
defined hematoma in the left aspect of the face, some of which overlies the left orbit. The most confluent
component of the hematoma is located in the subcutaneous fat at the level of the lateral aspect of the left
maxillary sinus and measures up to approximately 1.7 cm in the axial plane (series 11 image 42). No acute
abnormality seen in the orbits. There is no evidence of facial bone fracture. In particular, no orbital fracture.
Postoperative changes in the maxillary sinuses. There is trace mucosal thickening in the right maxillary
sinus. There is complete opacification of the right sphenoid sinus. There is partial fusion of the facets in the
upper cervical region.

IMPRESSION: Hematoma in the left aspect of the face. There is no evidence of facial bone fracture. IRINA

this exam: Automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size, and/or
use of iterative reconstruction technique. FINDINGS: ALIGNMENT: Normal. DISC SPACE HEIGHTS:
Disc space narrowing most severe C5-6 and C6-7. PRE-VERTEBRAL SOFT TISSUES: Groundglass
opacities in the right upper lobe possibly atypical pneumonia not well characterize. BONES: No fractures.
Facet disease. Multilevel facet ankylosis upper cervical spine. OTHER: None.

IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic abnormalities in the cervical spine. Groundglass opacities in the right
upper lobe possibly atypical pneumonia not well characterize. RODNEY OWEN 2/8/2024 12:19 PM

CT Head/Brain W/O Contrast

Result Date: 2/8/2024

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST INDICATION: Trauma COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE:
Computerized axial tomographic sections of the brain/head were obtained. Axial, coronal and sagittal
reformations performed and bone windows reviewed. No intravenous contrast was administered. Dose
reduction techniques was used using integrated, automated and adaptive dose reduction exposure
control. FINDINGS: The lateral ventricles, sulci over the convexities, and basilar cisterns, appear
within normal limits for age, without evidence of displacement. No mass, mass effect, midline shift, or
acute hemorrhage is observed. Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Moderate periventricular
ischemic white matter change and ischemic gliosis is not unusual for a patient of this age. The paranasal
sinuses demonstrate complete opacification sphenoid sinus without air-fluid level.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality evident. MICHAEL NUSSDORFER 2/8/2024 12:11

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST INDICATION: Trauma COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE:
Computerized axial tomographic sections of the brain/head were obtained. Axial, coronal and sagittal
reformations performed and bone windows reviewed. No intravenous contrast was administered. Dose
reduction techniques was used using integrated, automated and adaptive dose reduction exposure
control. FINDINGS: The lateral ventricles, sulci over the convexities, and basilar cisterns, appear
within normal limits for age, without evidence of displacement. No mass, mass effect, midline shift, or
acute hemorrhage is observed. Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Moderate periventricular
ischemic white matter change and ischemic gliosis is not unusual for a patient of this age. The paranasal
sinuses demonstrate complete opacification sphenoid sinus without air-fluid level.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality evident. MICHAEL NUSSDORFER 2/8/2024 12:11

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer, left upper lung cancer, left breast
cancer, right anterior rib pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Marilyn is a very nice 92 y.o. woman with a history of A fib (s/p ablations and cardioversion's, on
Coumadin), left breast cancer (s/p mastectomy in 1983 followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF),
and back melanoma (s/p resection) who was originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy from 9/20/12.
Patient was initially treated with radiation to the left upper lung by Dr. Farley Yang but it apparently
recurred locally and patient was treated with a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that revealed a 1.5 cm
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with pleural involvement that was positive for EGFR.

The patient was found on CT guided biopsy of a right upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a
recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was EGFR exon 19 deletion positive and the
patient was seen at Ironwood Cancer Center by Dr. Lesley Klein who recommended treatment with
Afatinib for suspected metastatic recurrence in the right upper lung and left lower lung. Patient was treated
with antibiotics with resolution of the left lower lung ground glass nodules with the right upper lung mass
staying stable at 1.2 cm and no mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen. Patient did undergo definitive
stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. patient was last seen by me at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and
then re-established care at this practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Patient
presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to HH Thompson Peak from 1/9/22 to 1/15/22 for community acquired
pneumonia and tested negative for Covid. She was treated with IV antibiotics that she completed she was
also found to have Afib with RVR and was placed on IV diltiazem and given lasix and continued on
Coumadin. A CT angio of the chest was negative for a PE and only showed bilateral pneumonia.

The patient was seen at HonorHealth Thompson Peak on 11/15/202 after suffering a fall. CT of the
C/T/L spine/HEAD were negative. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was negative aside from
atelectasis in the right upper lung lobe and a small renal cyst at the midpole. An X-ray of the chest showed
atelectasis in the right upper lobe and nodularity in the left upper lobe was unchanged. Patient was
ambulating with a walker and was discharged later that day and was advised to follow up with her PCP.
She presents for follow up.

The patient reports difficulty breathing last night before getting into bed, and she woke multiple
times throughout the night. It did improve with using an inhaler and intentionally coughing. Her shortness
of breath improved after cough up some mucous. The patient denies current shortness of breath. The
patient's last skin check was in 06/2023 and she had a squamous cell carcinoma from her left eye to her
lip that was removed with a Mohs with Dr. Lykins. She is scheduled for repeat skin check in 01/2024. The
patient denies any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. The patient denies any lymphadenopathy or
recent or frequent infections. The patient has not had any nosebleeds, gum bleeds, coffee ground emesis,
black or bloody stools. The patient reports neuropathy in her legs. The patient reports chronic diarrhea.
She denies constipation or abdominal pain. The patient's Coumadin for Afib was increased for 2 days after
a low INR, and patient has returned to her original dose.

IMAGING:

CT chest 10/03/2023: Right upper lobe bandlike scarring/atelectasis with bronchiectasis, unchanged and
likely postradiation related. Right middle lobe pleural-based nodule measuring 10 mm with adjacent

groundglass opacity, grossly unchanged from 06/16/2023 and 06/23/2023. Right upper lobe groundglass
opacity measuring 16 mm, unchanged. Additional findings as noted.

8/27/24, 8:46 AM Scott, Marilyn (MRN: 3222035) DOB: 9/6/1931

PET-CT 06/23/2023: Diminished volume and FDG uptake intensity of treated neoplasm and radiation
fibrosis in the right upper lobe, suggesting good local disease control. Previously described new right
middle lobe pulmonary nodule moderately hypermetabolic with PET, suspicious although not definitive for
malignancy, either metastatic or metachronous primary; consider CT-guided percutaneous biopsy for
definitive tissue diagnosis. Additional groundglass density lesions in the apical right upper lobe
demonstrating only low-level FDG uptake, continued imaging observation appropriate. No other definite
lymphatic or hematogenous metastases.

CT chest 06/16/2023: Stable right upper lobe parenchymal density consistent with radiation change.
Ground-glass density in the right apex is stable. New right middle lobe peripheral pleural-based nodule
measuring 1.4 cm. This is indeterminate. Suggest further evaluation with PET scan. Other small nodules
are stable. Other findings: Right chest wall elastofibroma, calcified coronary arteries, right renal artery
aneurysm, calcified hepatic granuloma, right renal artery cysts. Cardiomegaly. Left upper lobe lobectomy
with hyperexpansion of the left lung with scattered parenchymal scarring.

Right rib and chest x-ray 03/29/2023: Subacute appearing fracture in the anterior lateral aspect right 7th
rib. The remainder of the study appears similar to previous studies.

CT chest 9/20/2022: No metastasis detected. Stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5 mm 4 x 4 mm right lung apex
groundglass nodules without solid nidus, likely representing adenomatous hyperplasia spectrum lesions
(previously known as BAC). Moderate multi-chamber cardiomegaly. Moderately calcified mitral and aortic
valve annulus. Moderately calcified left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery
atherosclerosis. Mildly tortuous moderately calcified thoracic aorta is commonly seen with systemic
hypertension. 10 mm diameter peripherally calcified distal right renal artery aneurysm, stable compared
with 05/19/2020. No leak.

CT chest 3/23/22: Evolution of previously seen airspace opacities in the left lower lobe compatible with
resolved pneumonia. Stable changes from left upper lobectomy and postradiation fibrosis to the right
upper lobe measuring 3 cm. 6 and 8 mm right upper lobe groundglass nodules are stable.

CTA chest 1/9/22: No CT angiographic evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.Cardiomegaly.
Mediastinal adenopathy, mild. Left perihilar airspace disease and groundglass opacity suspicious for
pneumonia. Subsegmental airspace disease in the right upper lobe also likely reflects pneumonia.
Groundglass nodules present in the right middle lobe measuring up to 12 mm diameter. These are
indeterminate with respect to their inflammatory versus neoplastic etiology in the setting of prior
malignancy.

CT chest 10/1/2021: No evidence of metastatic disease. Stable solid and ground-glass nodules in the
right apex. Stable right upper lobe oblong density consistent with the patient's known non-small cell lung
cancer. There is some surrounding interstitial densities compatible post radiation change.

CT chest 5/19/20: Gradually decreasing size of the mass like consolidation in the right upper lobe which
likely reflects post radiation changes. The once visualized tumor in the right upper lobe remain obscured.
Stable right apical 7 mm semisolid nodule. Postsurgical change from partial left upper lobectomy. No new
pulmonary nodule or infiltrate. Bi-atrial enlargement and coronary artery consolidation. Non obstructing 5
mm right renal stone.

ASSESSMENTIPLAN:
1. Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer: Stage IA2(T1bNOMO) vs stage IV (T1a,NO,M1), isolated
metastatic recurrence to the right upper lung. Diagnosed on CT guided right upper lung biopsy of a right
upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was
positive for EGFR exon 19 deletion (EML4/ALK was negative and PDL1 was less than 1%). The patient
did apparently have a PET/CT on 9/7/17 that showed a ground glass nodule in the right upper lung
measuring 1.3 cm with an SUV of 1.5 and an area of atelectasis in the right lower lung. A CT chest from
2/26/18 showed a decrease in the biopsy proven right upper lung ground glass nodule and a new ground
glass nodule in the left lower lung that measured 9 x 11 mm and some mediastinal lymph nodes that were
less than 1 cm in size. Patient was treated with antibiotics and a follow up CT chest from 5/16/18 showed
resolution of the left lower lung nodule and lymphadenopathy.

Patient did undergo definitive stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. CT chest from 12/28/18
showed a significant change in the right apical nodule that was treated with radiation where it had
increased in size from 1.2 cm up to 4 x 3.6 cm and is now showing some consolidation in this area that

may be due to post radiation treatment. | did speak to Dr. Jerry Lucas about the CT scan who did feel this
was more likely due to be post radiation changes. Given that is had rapidly increased in size on CT scan
from 8/16/18 to CT from 12/28/18, | did obtain a PET/CT on 1/28/19 that showed the prior right upper lung
ground glass opacity was obscured by a larger parenchymal opacity in the right upper lung with SUV 3.4
(previously 1.5) that was most suggestive of inflammation rather than recurrent malignancy. No evidence
of metastatic disease.

Patient was see at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and then re-established care at my current
practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Brain MRI from 2020 showed no
evidence of metastatic disease. CT of the chest without contrast from 9/20/2022 showed stable 5 x 5 mm,
6 x 5mm, 4 x 4 mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing
adenomatous hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only
mentioned atelectasis in the right upper lung. Patient's last CEA from 08/18/2023 is stable but elevated at
4.1. CT of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET/CT from 06/23/2023
does show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic
or metachronous primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation
from 07/10/2023 to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert.

Her last CT of the chest from 10/03/2023 was unchanged showing a stable 1 cm right middle lung
pleural base nodule with adjacent groundglass nodules and an unchanged right upper lobe groundglass
opacity measuring 16 mm. | will check a CT of the chest in 01/2024.

2. Original left upper lung non small cell carcinoma: Originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy on 8/20/12.
Patient was apparently treated with radiation to this area by Dr. Farley Yang with a local recurrence.
Patient then underwent a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that showed a 1.5 cm mass with involvement of
the pleural that measured 1.5 cm and was positive for EGFR.

Patient had a CT of the chest without contrast on 9/20/2022 showed stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5 mm, 4
x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous
hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned atelectasis in
the right upper lung. Patient's last CEA from 08/18/2023 continues to mildly elevated but stable at 4.1. CT
of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET/CT from 06/23/2023 does
show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic or
metachronous primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation
from 07/10/2023 to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert.

Last CT of the chest from 10/03/2023 was unchanged showing a stable 1 cm right middle lung
pleural base nodule with adjacent groundglass nodules and an unchanged right upper lobe groundglass
opacity measuring 16 mm. | will check a CT of the chest in 01/2024.

3. Left breast cancer: S/p radical left mastectomy and simple right prophylactic mastectomy in 1983.
Patient was treated with adjuvant CMF.

4. Melanoma on back: S/p resection. Patient's last skin check from 06/2023 and was negative for any
melanoma recurrences but patient did have a Mohs procedure for a squamous cell carcinoma. Repeat
skin check in 01/2024.

5. Basal cell carcinoma: S/p resection in 10/2023. Patient's last skin check was in 06/2023 and she had a
squamous cell carcinoma from her left eye to her lip that was removed with a Mohs with Dr. Lykins. Repeat
skin check in 01/2024.

6. Right anterior rib pain: Resolved. Patient has right rib pain that has persisted since Monday after having
an esophagram done. Right rib x-ray from 03/29/2023 did show a subacute fracture of the right 7th rib.

7. Shortness of breath: Occurred yesterday prior to going to bed. Resolved after coughing up mucous.
She has not had any shortness of breath today. Her heart rate and oxygen saturation today are normal
and her lungs sound clear. If she has any bouts of recurrent shortness of breath, she is to go to the ER.

DISPOSITION: The patient will return to see my NP Josie Pirie in 12 weeks and me in 24 weeks time.
Labs (CBC, CMP, CEA) will be drawn one week prior to each visit.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your patient's care. Please feel free to contact me if any
questions or concerns arise.

Coumadin), left breast cancer (s/p mastectomy in 1983 followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF),
and back melanoma (s/p resection) who was originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy from 9/20/12.
Patient was initially treated with radiation to the left upper lung by Dr. Farley Yang but it apparently
recurred locally and patient was treated with a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that revealed a 1.5 cm
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with pleural involvement that was positive for EGFR.

The patient was found on CT guided biopsy of a right upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a
recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was EGFR exon 19 deletion positive and the
patient was seen at Ironwood Cancer Center by Dr. Lesley Klein who recommended treatment with
Afatinib for suspected metastatic recurrence in the right upper lung and left lower lung. Patient was treated
with antibiotics with resolution of the left lower lung ground glass nodules with the right upper lung mass
staying stable at 1.2 cm and no mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen. Patient did undergo definitive
stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. patient was last seen by me at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and
then re-established care at this practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Patient
presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to HH Thompson Peak from 1/9/22 to 1/15/22 for community acquired
pneumonia and tested negative for Covid. She was treated with IV antibiotics that she completed she was
also found to have Afib with RVR and was placed on IV diltiazem and given lasix and continued on
Coumadin. A CT angio of the chest was negative for a PE and only showed bilateral pneumonia.

The patient was seen at HonorHealth Thompson Peak on 11/15/202 after suffering a fall. CT of the
C/T/L spine/HEAD were negative. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was negative aside from
atelectasis in the right upper lung lobe and a small renal cyst at the midpole. An X-ray of the chest showed
atelectasis in the right upper lobe and nodularity in the left upper lobe was unchanged. Patient was
ambulating with a walker and was discharged later that day and was advised to follow up with her PCP.
She presents for follow up.

Patient has gained 3 lb since last visit. Her rib pain is improving. The patient denies any fever, chills,
night sweats. The patient has not had any nosebleeds, gum bleeds, coffee ground emesis, black or bloody
stools. She denies any odynophagia or dysphagia. Patient denies any shortness of breath or chest pain.
Patient did have some shortness of breath after radiation was complete that has now resolved.

IMAGING:

PET-CT 06/23/2023: Diminished volume and FDG uptake intensity of treated neoplasm and radiation
fibrosis in the right upper lobe, suggesting good local disease control. Previously described new right
middle lobe pulmonary nodule moderately hypermetabolic with PET, suspicious although not definitive for
malignancy, either metastatic or metachronous primary; consider CT-guided percutaneous biopsy for
definitive tissue diagnosis. Additional groundglass density lesions in the apical right upper lobe
demonstrating only low-level FDG uptake, continued imaging observation appropriate. No other definite
lymphatic or hematogenous metastases.

CT chest 06/16/2023: Stable right upper lobe parenchymal density consistent with radiation change.
Ground-glass density in the right apex is stable. New right middle lobe peripheral pleural-based nodule
measuring 1.4 cm. This is indeterminate. Suggest further evaluation with PET scan. Other small nodules
are stable. Other findings: Right chest wall elastofibroma, calcified coronary arteries, right renal artery
aneurysm, calcified hepatic granuloma, right renal artery cysts. Cardiomegaly. Left upper lobe lobectomy
with hyperexpansion of the left lung with scattered parenchymal scarring.

Right rib and chest x-ray 03/29/2023: Subacute appearing fracture in the anterior lateral aspect right 7th
rib, The remainder of the study appears similar to previous studies.

CT chest 9/20/2022: No metastasis detected. Stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5mm 4 x 4 mm right lung apex
groundglass nodules without solid nidus, likely representing adenomatous hyperplasia spectrum lesions

8/27/24, 8:46 AM Scott, Marilyn (MRN: 3222035) DOB: 9/6/1931

(previously known as BAC). Moderate multi-chamber cardiomegaly. Moderately calcified mitral and aortic
valve annulus. Moderately calcified left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery
atherosclerosis. Mildly tortuous moderately calcified thoracic aorta is commonly seen with systemic
hypertension. 10 mm diameter peripherally calcified distal right renal artery aneurysm, stable compared
with 05/19/2020. No leak.

CT chest 3/23/22: Evolution of previously seen airspace opacities in the left lower lobe compatible with
resolved pneumonia. Stable changes from left upper lobectomy and postradiation fibrosis to the right
upper lobe measuring 3 cm. 6 and 8 mm right upper lobe groundglass nodules are stable.

CTA chest 1/9/22: No CT angiographic evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.Cardiomegaly.
Mediastinal adenopathy, mild. Left perihilar airspace disease and groundglass opacity suspicious for
pneumonia. Subsegmental airspace disease in the right upper lobe also likely reflects pneumonia.
Groundglass nodules present in the right middle lobe measuring up to 12 mm diameter. These are
indeterminate with respect to their inflammatory versus neoplastic etiology in the setting of prior
malignancy.

CT chest 10/1/2021: No evidence of metastatic disease. Stable solid and ground-glass nodules in the
right apex. Stable right upper lobe oblong density consistent with the patient's known non-small cell lung
cancer. There is some surrounding interstitial densities compatible post radiation change.

CT chest 5/19/20: Gradually decreasing size of the mass like consolidation in the right upper lobe which
likely reflects post radiation changes. The once visualized tumor in the right upper lobe remain obscured.
Stable right apical 7 mm semisolid nodule. Postsurgical change from partial left upper lobectomy. No new
pulmonary nodule or infiltrate. Bi-atrial enlargement and coronary artery consolidation. Non obstructing 5
mm right renal stone.

ASSESSMENTI/PLAN:

1. Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer: Stage IA2(T1bNOMO) vs stage IV (T1a,NO,M1), isolated
metastatic recurrence to the right upper lung. Diagnosed on CT guided right upper lung biopsy of a right
upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was
positive for EGFR exon 19 deletion (EML4/ALK was negative and PDL1 was less than 1%). The patient
did apparently have a PET/CT On 9/7/17 that showed a ground glass nodule in the right upper lung
measuring 1.3 cm with an SUV of 1.5 and an area of atelectasis in the right lower lung. A CT chest from
2/26/18 showed a decrease in the biopsy proven right upper lung ground glass nodule and a new ground
glass nodule in the left lower lung that measured 9 x 11 mm and some mediastinal lymph nodes that were
less than 1 cm in size. Patient was treated with antibiotics and a follow up CT chest from 5/16/18 showed
resolution of the left lower lung nodule and lymphadenopathy.

Patient did undergo definitive stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. CT chest from 12/28/18
showed a significant change in the right apical nodule that was treated with radiation where it had
increased in size from 1.2 cm up to 4 x 3.6 cm and is now showing some consolidation in this area that
may be due to post radiation treatment. | did speak to Dr. Jerry Lucas about the CT scan who did feel this
was more likely due to be post radiation changes. Given that is had rapidly increased in size on CT scan
from 8/16/18 to CT from 12/28/18, | did obtain a PET/CT on 1/28/19 that showed the prior right upper lung
ground glass opacity was obscured by a larger parenchymal opacity in the right upper lung with SUV 3.4
(previously 1.5) that was most suggestive of inflammation rather than recurrent malignancy. No evidence
of metastatic disease.

Patient was see at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and then re-established care at this practice on
9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Brain MRI from 2020 showed no evidence of
metastatic disease. CT of the chest without contrast from 9/20/2022 showed stable 5x5mm,6x5mm,
4x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous
hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned atelectasis in
the right upper lung. Patients last CEA from 06/22/2023 is stable but elevated at 4.0. CT of the chest from
06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET-CT from 06/23/2023 does show that right
middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic or metachronous
primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation from 07/10/2023
to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert.

2. Original left upper lung non small cell carcinoma: Originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy on 8/20/12.
Patient was apparently treated with radiation to this area by Dr. Farley Yang with a local recurrence.

8/27/24, 8:46 AM Scott, Marilyn (MRN: 3222035) DOB: 9/6/1931

Patient then underwent a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that showed a 1.5 cm mass with involvement of
the pleural that measured 1.5 cm and was positive for EGFR.

Patient had a CT of the chest without contrast on 9/20/2022 showed stable5x5mm,6x5mm,4
x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous
hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned atelectasis in
the right upper lung. Patients last CEA from 06/22/2023 continues to mildly elevated but improved to 4.0.
CT of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET-CT from 06/23/2023
does show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic
or metachronous primary. Patient preferred radiation over a biopsy and received 4 treatments of radiation
from 07/10/2023 to 07/14/2023 with Dr. Ashley Albert. Patient has an appointment with Dr. Albert today.

3. Left breast cancer: S/p radical left mastectomy and simple right prophylactic mastectomy in 1983.
Patient was treated with adjuvant CMF.

4. Melanoma on back: S/p resection. Patients last skin check from 1/2023 and was negative for any
melanoma recurrences.

5. Basal cell carcinoma: S/p resection in 10/2023. A repeat skin check from 1/2023 was apparently
negative.

6. Right anterior rib pain: Improving. Patient has right rib pain that has persisted since Monday after
having an esophagram done. Right rib x-ray from 03/29/2023 did show a subacute fracture of the right 7th
rib.

DISPOSITION: The patient will return to see Dr. Bibb in 8-12 weeks.
PLAN: CBC, CMP, CEA one week prior to each visit.

The patient was discussed with Dr. John Bibb who agrees with the assessment and plan.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your patient's care. Please feel free to contact me if any

b. S/p adjuvant CMF

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer, left upper lung cancer, left breast
cancer, right anterior rib pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Marilyn is a very nice 90 y.o. woman with a history of A fib (s/p ablations and cardioversion's, on
Coumadin), left breast cancer (s/p mastectomy in 1983 followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF),
and back melanoma (s/p resection) who was originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy from 9/20/12.
Patient was initially treated with radiation to the left upper lung by Dr. Farley Yang but it apparently
recurred locally and patient was treated with a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that revealed a 1.5 cm
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with pleural involvement that was positive for EGFR.

The patient was found on CT guided biopsy of a right upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a
recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was EGFR exon 19 deletion positive and the
patient was seen at Ironwood Cancer Center by Dr. Lesley Klein who recommended treatment with
Afatinib for suspected metastatic recurrence in the right upper lung and left lower lung. Patient was treated
with antibiotics with resolution of the left lower lung ground glass nodules with the right upper lung mass
staying stable at 1.2 cm and no mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen. Patient did undergo definitive
stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. patient was last seen by me at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and
then re-established care at this practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Patient
presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to HH Thompson Peak from 1/9/22 to 1/15/22 for community acquired
pneumonia and tested negative for Covid. She was treated with IV antibiotics that she completed she was
also found to have Afib with RVR and was placed on IV diltiazem and given lasix and continued on
Coumadin. A CT angio of the chest was negative for a PE and only showed bilateral pneumonia.

The patient was seen at HonorHealth Thompson Peak on 11/15/202 after suffering a fall. CT of the
C/T/L spine/HEAD were negative. ACT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was negative aside from
atelectasis in the right upper lung lobe and a small renal cyst at the midpole. An X-ray of the chest showed
atelectasis in the right upper lobe and nodularity in the left upper lobe was unchanged. Patient was
ambulating with a walker and was discharged later that day and was advised to follow up with her PCP.
She presents for follow up.

Her rib pain is improving. The patient denies any fever, chills, night sweats. The patient has not had
any nosebleeds, gum bleeds, coffee ground emesis, black or bloody stools. She denies any odynophagia
or dysphagia. Patient denies any shortness of breath or chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insomnia, neuropathy, DM, hypothyroidism, macular degeneration, OA,
fibrocystic breast,

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Ovarian cyst removal, c-section, lumpectomy, left mastectomy, cardiac
ablation, right prophylactic mastectomy, tonsillectomy, sinus surgery, left arm lipoma removal, eye surgery,

IMAGING:

PET-CT 06/23/2023: Diminished volume and FDG uptake intensity of treated neoplasm and radiation
fibrosis in the right upper lobe, suggesting good local disease control. Previously described new right
middle lobe pulmonary nodule moderately hypermetabolic with PET, suspicious although not definitive for
malignancy, either metastatic or metachronous primary; consider CT-guided percutaneous biopsy for
definitive tissue diagnosis. Additional groundglass density lesions in the apical right upper lobe
demonstrating only low-level FDG uptake, continued imaging observation appropriate. No other definite
lymphatic or hematogenous metastases.

CT chest 06/16/2023: Stable right upper lobe parenchymal density consistent with radiation change.
Ground-glass density in the right apex is stable. New right middle lobe peripheral pleural-based nodule
measuring 1.4 cm. This is indeterminate. Suggest further evaluation with PET scan. Other small nodules
are stable. Other findings: Right chest wall elastofibroma, calcified coronary arteries, right renal artery
aneurysm, calcified hepatic granuloma, right renal artery cysts. Cardiomegaly. Left upper lobe lobectomy
with hyperexpansion of the left lung with scattered parenchymal scarring.

Right rib and chest x-ray 03/29/2023: Subacute appearing fracture in the anterior lateral aspect right 7th
rib. The remainder of the study appears similar to previous studies.

CT chest 9/20/2022: No metastasis detected. Stable 5 x 5 mm, 6 x 5 mm 4 x 4 mm right lung apex
groundglass nodules without solid nidus, likely representing adenomatous hyperplasia spectrum lesions
(previously known as BAC). Moderate multi-chamber cardiomegaly. Moderately calcified mitral and aortic
valve annulus. Moderately calcified left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery
atherosclerosis. Mildly tortuous moderately calcified thoracic aorta is commonly seen with systemic
hypertension. 10 mm diameter peripherally calcified distal right renal artery aneurysm, stable compared
with 05/19/2020. No leak.

CT chest 3/23/22: Evolution of previously seen airspace opacities in the left lower lobe compatible with
resolved pneumonia. Stable changes from left upper lobectomy and postradiation fibrosis to the right
upper lobe measuring 3 cm. 6 and 8 mm right upper lobe groundglass nodules are stable.

CTA chest 1/9/22: No CT angiographic evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.Cardiomegaly.
Mediastinal adenopathy, mild. Left perihilar airspace disease and groundglass opacity suspicious for
pneumonia. Subsegmental airspace disease in the right upper lobe also likely reflects pneumonia.
Groundglass nodules present in the right middle lobe measuring up to 12 mm diameter. These are
indeterminate with respect to their inflammatory versus neoplastic etiology in the setting of prior
malignancy.

CT chest 10/1/2021: No evidence of metastatic disease. Stable solid and ground-glass nodules in the
right apex. Stable right upper lobe oblong density consistent with the patient's known non-small cell lung
cancer. There is some surrounding interstitial densities compatible post radiation change.

CT chest 5/19/20: Gradually decreasing size of the mass like consolidation in the right upper lobe which
likely reflects post radiation changes. The once visualized tumor in the right upper lobe remain obscured.
Stable right apical 7 mm semisolid nodule. Postsurgical change from partial left upper lobectomy. No new
pulmonary nodule or infiltrate. Bi-atrial enlargement and coronary artery consolidation. Non obstructing 5
mm right renal stone.

ASSESSMENTI/PLAN:

1. Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer: Stage I[A2(T1bNOMO) vs stage IV (T1a,NO,M1), isolated
metastatic recurrence to the right upper lung. Diagnosed on CT guided right upper lung biopsy of a right
upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was
positive for EGFR exon 19 deletion (EML4/ALK was negative and PDL1 was less than 1%). The patient
did apparently have a PET/CT On 9/7/17 that showed a ground glass nodule in the right upper lung
measuring 1.3 cm with an SUV of 1.5 and an area of atelectasis in the right lower lung. A CT chest from
2/26/18 showed a decrease in the biopsy proven right upper lung ground glass nodule and a new ground
glass nodule in the left lower lung that measured 9 x 11 mm and some mediastinal lymph nodes that were
less than 1 cm in size. Patient was treated with antibiotics and a follow up CT chest from 5/16/18 showed
resolution of the left lower lung nodule and lymphadenopathy.

Scott, Marilyn (MRN 3222035) Printed by Katherine Stevens [145643] at 8/27/2024 8:46 AM

Patient did undergo definitive stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. CT chest from 12/28/18
showed a significant change in the right apical nodule that was treated with radiation where it had
increased in size from 1.2 cm up to 4 x 3.6 cm and is now showing some consolidation in this area that
may be due to post radiation treatment. | did speak to Dr. Jerry Lucas about the CT scan who did feel this
was more likely due to be post radiation changes. Given that is had rapidly increased in size on CT scan
from 8/16/18 to CT from 12/28/18, | did obtain a PET/CT on 1/28/19 that showed the prior right upper lung
ground glass opacity was obscured by a larger parenchymal opacity in the right upper lung with SUV 3.4
(previously 1.5) that was most suggestive of inflammation rather than recurrent malignancy. No evidence
of metastatic disease.

Patient was see at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and then re-established care at this practice on
9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Brain MRI from 2020 showed no evidence of
metastatic disease. CT of the chest without contrast from 9/20/2022 showed stable5x5mm,6x5mm,
4x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous
hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned atelectasis in
the right upper lung. Patients last CEA from 06/22/2023 is stable but elevated at 4.0. CT of the chest from
06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET-CT from 06/23/2023 does show that right
middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic or metachronous
primary. Plan was to have patient see Dr. Menashe to evaluate for a biopsy as well as Dr. Sckolnick to
evaluate for possible radiation without biopsy. Patient would prefer radiation over a biopsy if possible. Dr.
Sckolnick is out of office and | have been in contact with Dr. Ashley Albert who will see patient today for
evaluation. If a biopsy is needed for the radiatio | will have patient see Dr. Menashe.

2. Original left upper lung non small cell carcinoma: Originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy on 8/20/12.
Patient was apparently treated with radiation to this area by Dr. Farley Yang with a local recurrence.
Patient then underwent a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that showed a 1.5 cm mass with involvement of
the pleural that measured 1.5 cm and was positive for EGFR.

Patient had a CT of the chest without contrast on 9/20/2022 showed stable 5 x5mm,6x5mm,4
x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous
hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned atelectasis in
the right upper lung. Patients last CEA from 06/22/2023 continues to mildly elevated but improved to 4.0.
CT of the chest from 06/16/2023 does show a new right middle lobe nodule. PET-CT from 06/23/2023
does show that right middle lobe nodule with moderate hypermetabolic uptake could be either metastatic
or metachronous primary. Plan was to have patient see Dr. Menashe to evaluate for a biopsy as well as Dr.
Sckolnick to evaluate for possible radiation without biopsy. Patient would prefer radiation over a biopsy if
possible. Dr. Sckolnick is out of office and | have been in contact with Dr. Ashley Albert who will see patient
today for evaluation. If a biopsy is needed for the radiatio | will have patient see Dr. Menashe.

3. Left breast cancer: S/p radical left mastectomy and simple right prophylactic mastectomy in 1983.
Patient was treated with adjuvant CMF.

4. Melanoma on back: S/p resection. Patients last skin check from 1/2023 and was negative for any
melanoma recurrences.

5. Basal cell carcinoma: S/p resection in 10/2023. A repeat skin check from 1/2023 was apparently
negative.

6. Right anterior rib pain: Improving. Patient has right rib pain that has persisted since Monday after
having an esophagram done. Right rib x-ray from 03/29/2023 did show a subacute fracture of the right 7th
rib.

DISPOSITION: The patient will return to see Dr. Bibb in 6 weeks.

PLAN: CBC, CMP, CEA one week prior to each visit.

The patient was discussed with Dr. John Bibb who agrees with the assessment and plan.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your patient's care. Please feel free to contact me if any
questions or concerns arise.

Josie,

You see patient on 6/28/2023, patients PET scan is showing a new, hypermetabolic right middle
lung nodule that may be a new lung cancer. Please send patient to see Dr. Menashe of
Pulmonary to see if a biopsy is possible or recommended. Also, call Dr. Sckolnik and ask him to
see patient as Dr. Yang is retired and it may be possible to just consider radiation without a biopsy
but lest see what he thinks.

b. S/p adjuvant CMF

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer, left upper lung cancer, left breast
cancer, right anterior rib pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Marilyn is a very nice 90 y.o. woman with a history of A fib (s/p ablations and cardioversion's, on
Coumadin), left breast cancer (s/p mastectomy in 1983 followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF),
and back melanoma (s/p resection) who was originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy from 9/20/12.
Patient was initially treated with radiation to the left upper lung by Dr. Farley Yang but it apparently
recurred locally and patient was treated with a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that revealed a 1.5 cm
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with pleural involvement that was positive for EGFR.

The patient was found on CT guided biopsy of a right upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a
recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was EGFR exon 19 deletion positive and the
patient was seen at Ironwood Cancer Center by Dr. Lesley Klein who recommended treatment with
Afatinib for suspected metastatic recurrence in the right upper lung and left lower lung. Patient was treated
with antibiotics with resolution of the left lower lung ground glass nodules with the right upper lung mass
staying stable at 1.2 cm and no mediastinal lymphadenopathy seen. Patient did undergo definitive
stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. patient was last seen by me at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and
then re-established care at this practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Patient
presents for follow up.

Patient was admitted to HH Thompson Peak from 1/9/22 to 1/15/22 for community acquired
pneumonia and tested negative for Covid. She was treated with IV antibiotics that she completed she was
also found to have Afib with RVR and was placed on IV diltiazem and given lasix and continued on
Coumadin. A CT angio of the chest was negative for a PE and only showed bilateral pneumonia.

The patient was seen at HonorHealth Thompson Peak on 11/15/202 after suffering a fall. CT of the
C/T/L spine/HEAD were negative. A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was negative aside from
atelectasis in the right upper lung lobe and a small renal cyst at the midpole. An X-ray of the chest showed
atelectasis in the right upper lobe and nodularity in the left upper lobe was unchanged. Patient was
ambulating with a walker and was discharged later that day and was advised to follow up with her PCP.
She presents for follow up.

She has had right anterior rib pain since Monday and having an esophagram done at SMIL. The
patient denies any fever, chills, night sweats. She has lost 15 pounds since her last visit secondary to
decreased appetite. She reports difficulty swallowing pills at times but not with food of liquids. The patient
denies any lymphadenopathy or recent or frequent infections. The patient has not had any nosebleeds,
gum bleeds, coffee ground emesis, black or bloody stools. She denies any odynophagia or dysphagia.
Patient denies any shortness of breath or chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insomnia, neuropathy, DM, hypothyroidism, macular degeneration, OA,
fibrocystic breast,

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Ovarian cyst removal, c-section, lumpectomy, left mastectomy, cardiac
ablation, right prophylactic mastectomy, tonsillectomy, sinus surgery, left arm lipoma removal, eye surgery,

groundglass nodules without solid nidus, likely representing adenomatous hyperplasia spectrum lesions

(previously known as BAC). Moderate multi-chamber cardiomegaly. Moderately calcified mitral and aortic

valve annulus. Moderately calcified left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery
atherosclerosis. Mildly tortuous moderately calcified thoracic aorta is commonly seen with systemic
hypertension. 10 mm diameter peripherally calcified distal right renal artery aneurysm, stable compared
with 05/19/2020. No leak.

CT chest 3/23/22: Evolution of previously seen airspace opacities in the left lower lobe compatible with
resolved pneumonia. Stable changes from left upper lobectomy and postradiation fibrosis to the right
upper lobe measuring 3 cm. 6 and 8 mm right upper lobe groundglass nodules are stable.

CTA chest 1/9/22: No CT angiographic evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.Cardiomegaly.
Mediastinal adenopathy, mild. Left perihilar airspace disease and groundglass opacity suspicious for
pneumonia. Subsegmental airspace disease in the right upper lobe also likely reflects pneumonia.
Groundglass nodules present in the right middle lobe measuring up to 12 mm diameter. These are
indeterminate with respect to their inflammatory versus neoplastic etiology in the setting of prior
malignancy.

CT chest 10/1/2021: No evidence of metastatic disease. Stable solid and ground-glass nodules in the
right apex. Stable right upper lobe oblong density consistent with the patient's known non-small cell lung
cancer. There is some surrounding interstitial densities compatible post radiation change.

CT chest 5/19/20: Gradually decreasing size of the mass like consolidation in the right upper lobe which
likely reflects post radiation changes. The once visualized tumor in the right upper lobe remain obscured.
Stable right apical 7 mm semisolid nodule. Postsurgical change from partial left upper lobectomy. No new
pulmonary nodule or infiltrate. Bi-atrial enlargement and coronary artery consolidation. Non obstructing 5
mm right renal stone.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:

1. Right upper lung non-small cell lung cancer: Stage [A2(T1bNOMO) vs stage IV (T1a,NO,M1), isolated
metastatic recurrence to the right upper lung. Diagnosed on CT guided right upper lung biopsy of a right
upper lung mass from 9/26/17 to have a recurrence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma that was
positive for EGFR exon 19 deletion (EML4/ALK was negative and PDL1 was less than 1%). The patient
did apparently have a PET/CT On 9/7/17 that showed a ground glass nodule in the right upper lung
measuring 1.3 cm with an SUV of 1.5 and an area of atelectasis in the right lower lung. A CT chest from
2/26/18 showed a decrease in the biopsy proven right upper lung ground glass nodule and a new ground
glass nodule in the left lower lung that measured 9 x 11 mm and some mediastinal lymph nodes that were
less than 1 cm in size. Patient was treated with antibiotics and a follow up CT chest from 5/16/18 showed
resolution of the left lower lung nodule and lymphadenopathy.

Patient did undergo definitive stereotactic body radiation on 6/25/18. CT chest from 12/28/18
showed a significant change in the right apical nodule that was treated with radiation where it had
increased in size from 1.2 cm up to 4 x 3.6 cm and is now showing some consolidation in this area that
may be due to post radiation treatment. | did speak to Dr. Jerry Lucas about the CT scan who did feel this
was more likely due to be post radiation changes. Given that is had rapidly increased in size on CT scan
from 8/16/18 to CT from 12/28/18, | did obtain a PET/CT on 1/28/19 that showed the prior right upper lung
ground glass opacity was obscured by a larger parenchymal opacity in the right upper lung with SUV 3.4
(previously 1.5) that was most suggestive of inflammation rather than recurrent malignancy. No evidence
of metastatic disease.

Patient was last seen by me at Arizona Oncology on 7/10/19 and then re-established care at this
practice on 9/17/2021 and in between was followed by Dr. Roberts. Brain MRI from 2020 showed no
evidence of metastatic disease. CT of the chest without contrast from 9/20/2022 showed stable 5x 5mm,
6x5mm, 4x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing
adenomatous hyperplasia (previously called BAC). A follow up CT of the C/A/P/C/T/L spine only mentioned
atelectasis in the right upper lung. Patients last CEA from 3/22/2023 was mildly elevated at 4.8. | will
check a CT of the chest w/o contrast in 5/2023 and them every 6 months.

2. Original left upper lung non small cell carcinoma: Originally diagnosed with a left upper lung stage IIA
(T2aNOMO) moderately differentiated, EGFR positive adenocarcinoma by a left lung biopsy on 8/20/12.
Patient was apparently treated with radiation to this area by Dr. Farley Yang with a local recurrence.
Patient then underwent a left upper lobectomy on 5/13/13 that showed a 1.5 cm mass with involvement of
the pleural that measured 1.5 cm and was positive for EGFR.

Patient had a CT of the chest without contrast on 9/20/2022 showed stable 5x 5mm,6x5mm, 4
x 4mm right lung apex groundglass nodules without a solid component likely representing adenomatous

3. Left breast cancer: S/p radical left mastectomy and simple right prophylactic mastectomy in 1983.
Patient was treated with adjuvant CMF.

4. Melanoma on back: S/p resection. Patients last skin check from 1/2023 and was negative for any
melanoma recurrences.

5. Basal cell carcinoma: S/p resection in 10/2023. A repeat skin check from 1/2023 was apparently
negative.

6. Right anterior rib pain: Patient has right rib pain that has persisted since Monday after having an
esophagram done. | will order a right rib x ray.

Summary
Noncontrast study.

Suboptimal Doppler signal for aortic valve gradient assessment. Consider a limited echo study with
contrast or invasive

hemodynamic assessment for aortic valve pressure gradient as clinically directed.

Normal left ventricular size. There is moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low-normal with an EF between 50-55%, estimated visually.
Hypokinesis in apical septal and true apex segments.

Grade II diastolic dysfunction (moderate increase in filling pressures).

Right ventricle is normal in size and systolic function.

Mild pulmonary hypertension.

The IVC is normal in size with greater than 50% collapse with inspiration.

There is no significant pericardial effusion.

Compared to prior 2020 study, suboptimal Doppler signal for aortic valve gradient assessment.
Consider a limited echo study

with contrast or invasive hemodynamic assessment for aortic valve pressure gradient as clinically
directed. Aortic stenosis was

moderate in prior study with peak velocity of 3.6 ms and mean gradient of 32 mmHg. Compared to
prior study, LV function

appears low normal with wall motion abnormality in apical septal and true apex segments. Consider a
limited echo study with

contrast for LV function assessment/RWMA as clinically directed.

Clinical Notes (continued)

Valvular heart disease:

e We have reviewed TTE and aortic valve is heavily calcified. He is symptomatic. We feel he would benefit from
aortic valve replacement.

We will obtain TAVR CTA. Patient is edentulous

He will need to be evaluated by CT surgery

Once this has been completed, we will present to heart team for discussion and planning.

This has been discussed with patient and daughter and they are both agreeable to this plan of care.

Chronic HFpEF
e Currently euvolemic - continue with current plan of care and medical therapy

HTN
e Controlled
e Continue with current medical therapy

DM II - insulin therapy; Last hemoglobin A1C 6.3 (03/2023) - (7.5 12/08/2022)
Cirrhosis - on spironolactone. LFTs normal 03/2023. Bilirubin 1.3; INR 1.1 (10/2019)

We will make further recommendations pending the above testing.
Signed: John Schindler, MD 7/27/2023, 9:11 AM

| agree with the findings as outlined by ACP Harris. | have performed an independent evaluation. | have personally
reviewed the imaging studies to include the prior echo. The patient is a pleasant 76-year-old male who is accompanied
by his daughter. He has a history of alcohol induced cirrhosis with esophageal varices, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension and severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. He was previously followed by Dr. Sura who has since
transitioned to another practice. Patient states that he was previously aerobically active but has not been active
recently due to an inability to engage in such activities. Unfortunately, he continues to drink alcohol despite his
diagnosis of alcohol induced cirrhosis. He had an episode of hematemesis approximately 3 to 4 years ago and has
not undergone esophageal banding to date. He denies any ascites or anasarca. On exam, he is normotensive and
euvolemic. His transthoracic echocardiogram reveals a heavily calcified and restricted aortic valve with high gradient
AS in the setting of preserved biventricular systolic function. We discussed the risks and benefits of potential TAVR
therapy. He is interested and will be scheduled for a CTA in the near future. He is edentulous which will negate the
need for a dental evaluation. Once the CT is available for review, he will be discussed in a heart team format.

Narrative:

HISTORY: Aortic valve replacement (TAVR), pre-op eval
Aortic valve replacement (TAVR), pre-op eval
Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis

COMPARISONS: None.
CTA OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:

CTA of the chest was performed with multiple axial sections after IV contrast. Coronal, LAO, and 3-D
reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. A gated acquisition was performed to
eliminate cardiac motion artifact.

Additionally, on a separate workstation | personally performed quantitative aortic valve calcium
measurements, as well as, created multiplanar oblique images for fly-through evaluation of the
aortic valve.

For all CaroMont Health Care System CT exams, one or more of the following radiation dose reduction
techniques were used to achieve the minimum dose exposure while maintaining necessary diagnostic
image quality: automated exposure control, BMI based dose modulation, and iterative reconstruction
technique. CTDIvol: .6 - 66.9 mGy. DLP: 2365 mGy-cm.

TECHNICAL QUALITY:Good.
The examination was not optimized for evaluation of the coronary arteries.

Aorta/Aortic arch:

Ascending aorta: Minimal calcium is seen along the left lateral margin.
Sinotubular junction: Minimal calcium.

Left subclavian artery: WNL.

An addendum for aortic valve scoring and morphology will be performed when the software becomes
available.

Sub-annular calcium: None.

Pulmonary vasculature: There is normal perfusion of the pulmonary arteries.
Heart: Mild coronary atherosclerosis. Moderate MAC.

Mediastinum: No adenopathy.
Lungs: No acute consolidations or effusions.

Musculoskeletal: Intact.

CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:

CTA of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with multiple axial sections after IV contrast.
Coronal, sagittal, and 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.

Aorta: There is mild circumferential atherosclerosis. However, there is a moderate, focal area of
plaque along the posterior margin of the aorta along the distal segment. This narrows the lumen to
11x17mm.

lliac arteries:

Atherosclerosis: Within normal limits.
Tortuosity: Within normal limits.

Minimum diameter: Right 9 mm. Left 9 mm.

Common femoral arteries:
Atherosclerosis: Within normal limits.

Minimum diameter: Right 10 mm. Left 8 mm.

There is advanced cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension with recanalization of the
umbilical vein. The spleen is prominent measuring 13 mm .

Cholelithiasis. Mild urinary bladder distention. Moderate diverticulosis coli. Right hemicolectomy.
The remainder of the abdomen appears within normal limits for the patients age.

Impression:

Focal distal abdominal aortic noncalcified plaque. Otherwise, no apparent access issues.
Advanced cirrhosis with portal hypertension.

Aortic valve score and morphology TBD.

Summary
Noncontrast study.

Suboptimal Doppler signal for aortic valve gradient assessment. Consider a limited echo study with
contrast or invasive

hemodynamic assessment for aortic valve pressure gradient as clinically directed.

Normal left ventricular size. There is moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low-normal with an EF between 50-55%, estimated visually.
Hypokinesis in apical septal and true apex segments.

Grade II diastolic dysfunction (moderate increase in filling pressures).

Right ventricle is normal in size and systolic function.

Mild pulmonary hypertension.

The IVC is normal in size with greater than 50% collapse with inspiration.

There is no significant pericardial effusion.

Compared to prior 2020 study, suboptimal Doppler signal for aortic valve gradient assessment.
Consider a limited echo study

with contrast or invasive hemodynamic assessment for aortic valve pressure gradient as clinically
directed. Aortic stenosis was

moderate in prior study with peak velocity of 3.6 ms and mean gradient of 32 mmHg. Compared to
prior study, LV function

appears low normal with wall motion abnormality in apical septal and true apex segments. Consider a
limited echo study with

contrast for LV function assessment/RWMA as clinically directed.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIABETES INSTRUCTIONS
Managing your blood glucose before surgery

When you have diabetes, managing your blood glucose is always important. But before surgery, it's vital. This
sheet tells you why and explains what you can do to prepare for surgery. Managing your blood glucose levels
before surgery can help you avoid problems and recover more quickly.

Instructions (continued)

Surgery is stressful. Stress usually increases before, during, and after surgery. Beforehand, you're probably
a bit nervous. During and after surgery, your body is stressed, trying to heal itself. And unfortunately, stress
makes your body release hormones that make it even more difficult than usual to regulate blood glucose.

You may go off your normal meal plan. Often your doctor will give you special instructions about eating
and drinking in the hours before surgery. And for a few days after, you might not eat normally either.
Going away from your meal plan can cause changes to blood glucose levels.

Your medication routine may change temporarily. Depending on what type you take, you may need to
switch to a different medication, or adjust your dose as instructed by your physician.

Continuous glucose monitoring devices. If you wear a continuous glucose monitoring device such as a
Dexcom or Libre, this device will need to be removed before going into the operating room for safety
purposes. Please make plans accordingly. You may contact the device company for a replacement if
required to remove early due to surgery.

INSTRUCTIONS:
+ The day and evening prior to surgery, maintain your usual meal plan and insulin dose and/or oral diabetic
medications.

If you take insulin,

° Check your fingerstick blood glucose at bedtime.
° If your blood glucose is greater than 180, take your insulin according to your normal routine.
Remember, you are not going to be eating or drinking anything after midnight.

If you become hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) treat with glucose gel. Be sure to tell the nurse on arrival to
surgery that you were hypoglycemic.

On the morning of surgery before coming to the hospital take this dose of insulin: NONE

DO NOT take ANY of these oral or injectable diabetic medications, Byetta, Bydureon, Victoza, Trulicity, and
Rybelsus or any other GLP1 drugs, or any short acting insulin (Novolog, Humalog, Apidra, or Regular) on the
morning of surgery.

The Nurse will check your blood sugar when you get to the hospital and throughout your stay.

GUIDE TO SKIN CLEANSING BEFORE SURGERY

Before surgery, you can play an important role in your own health. Because skin is not sterile, your skin needs to
be as free of germs as possible before surgery. You can reduce the number of germs on your skin by washing with
Hibiclens. Hibiclens is an antiseptic that kills germs on contact and bonds with the skin to continue killing germs
even after washing. Your Surgeon has ordered this skin cleaning procedure to help prevent infections. Please
follow these instructions carefully.

Please do not use if you have an allergy to chlorhexidine, the active ingredient in Hibiclens.

Date of Surgery: 8/29/23

Shower or Bathe 2 nights before surgery:

ON
8/27/23
8/28/23

1. Use approximately half a bottle of Hibiclens for each bath.

2. If you plan to wash your hair, use your regular shampoo. Rinse well.

3. Wash your face with your regular soap. Rinse well.

4. Apply Hibiclens. Do not get any in your eyes, nose, or ears. Wash thoroughly, from the neck down, paying
special attention to the area where your surgery will be performed. DO NOT use Hibiclens on your head
or genital area. Wash your body gently for 5 minutes. Do not scrub your skin too hard. Rinse thoroughly.

5. Pat dry with a clean towel.

6. DO NOT apply lotions or moisturizers, or powder.

7. If you receive 2 bottles of Hibiclens, keep one for use after surgery.

“Surgical Site

Infections”

What is o Surgical Site Infection (SSI)?
‘Assurgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the
part of the body where the surgery took place. Most patients who have
surgery do not develop an infection. However, infections develop in
about 1 to 3 out of every 100 patients who have surgery.
Some of the common symptoms of a surgical site infection are:

* Redness and pain around the area where you had surgery

* Drainage of cloudy fluid from your surgical wound

* Fever

Can SSis be treated?

Yes, Most surgical site infections can be treated with antibiotics. The
antibiotic given to you depends on the bacteria (germs) causing the
infection. Sometimes patients with SSis also need another surgery to
treat the infection.

What are some of the things that hospitals are doing to prevent SSis?
To prevent SSis, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers:

* Clean their hands and arms up to their elbows with an antiseptic
agent just before the surgery.

‘+ Clean their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
rub before and after caring for each patient.

+ May remove some of your hair immediately before your surgery
using electric clippers ifthe hair isin the same area where the pro-
cedure will occur. They should not shave you with a razor.

* Wear special hair covers, masks, gowns, and gloves during surgery
to keep the surgery area clean.

* Give you antibiotics before your surgery starts. In most cases, you
should get antibiotics within 60 minutes before the surgery starts
and the antibiotics should be stopped within 24 hours after surgery.

‘+ Clean the skin at the site of your surgery with a special soap that
kills germs.

What can | do to help prevent SSis?

Before your surgery:
* Tell your doctor about other medical problems you may have.
Health problems such as allergies, diabetes, and obesity could af-
fect your surgery and your treatment.

Printed on 9/30/24 10:58 AM

'* Quit smoking. Patients who smoke get more infections. Talk to your
doctor about how you can quit before your surgery.

* Do not shave near where you will have surgery. Shaving with a razor
an irritate your skin and make it easier to develop an infection.

At the time of your surgery:

‘+ Speak up if someone tries to shave you with a razor before surgery.
‘Ask why you need to be shaved and talk with your surgeon if you have
any concerns.

** Ask if you will get antibiotics before surgery.

After your surgery:

* Make sure that your healthcare providers clean their hands before
‘examining you, either with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
rub.

If you do

‘* Family and friends who visit you should not touch the surgical wound
or dressings.

‘+ Family and friends should clean their hands with soap and water or an
alcohol-based hand rub before and after visiting you. If you do not see
them clean their hands, ask them to clean their hands.

What do | need to do when | go home from the hospital?

* Before you go home, your doctor or nurse should explain everything
you need to know about taking care of your wound. Make sure you
understand how to care for your wound before you leave the hospital.

* Always clean your hands before and after caring for your wound.

* Before you go home, make sure you know who to contact if you have
questions or problems after you get home.

* If you have any symptoms of an infection, such as redness and pain at
the surgery site, drainage, or fever, call your doctor immediately.

If you have additional questions, please ask your doctor or nurse.

Developing a Pain Management Plan: After Your Visit

Your Care Instructions

Some diseases and injuries can cause pain that lasts a long time. You don't need to live with uncontrolled pain. A pain
management plan helps you find ways to control pain with side effects you can live with.

There are things you can do to help with pain. Only you know how much pain you feel. Constant pain can make you
depressed. It can cause stress and make it hard for you to eat and sleep. But there are ways to control the pain. They can
help you stay active, improve your mood, and heal faster.

Your plan can include many types of pain control. You may take prescription or over-the-counter drugs. You can also try
physical treatments and behavioral methods. Some medical treatments also help with pain. For example, radiation can be
used to reduce pain from bone cancer.

You and your doctor will work to make your plan. Be sure to read it often. Change it if your pain is not under control.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?
Physical treatments

+ Be safe with medicines. Take pain medicines exactly as directed.
° If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it exactly as prescribed. Recording the times you took
medicine may help you ensure medication is taken as prescribed.
° If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.
+ If your pain medicine causes side effects such as constipation or nausea, you may need to take other medicines for
those problems. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you have.

Behavioral treatments

Biofeedback teaches you to control a body function that you normally don't think about. These are things like skin
temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. At first, you will use a machine to give you feedback on the function you
want to control. Then a therapist will teach you what to do next. Over time, you can stop using the machine.

+ Breathing techniques can help you relax and get rid of tension.

Guided imagery is a series of thoughts and images that can focus your attention away from your pain. When you do
it, you use all your senses to help your body respond as though what you are imagining is real.

Hypnosis is a state of focused concentration that makes you less aware of your surroundings. It may cause your brain
to release chemicals that relieve pain. You can have a therapist help you through hypnosis. Or you can learn to use it
‘on yourself.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of counseling. It helps you change your thought patterns. Changes in your
thoughts can help change your behavior and the way you perceive your body.

Other non-medicine treatments from the hospital

(continued)

+ In the hospital, you may have experienced some non-medicine comfort treatments such as: deep breathing,
positioning, repositioning, using blankets or pillows, or pillows to splint area of pain, using security objects, cool
cloth, decreasing distractions or lowering the lighting, family presence, minimizing unnecessary movement, music, or
verbalization. Play therapy, rocking, and swaddling, may help infants and children. Some of these may have worked
to control or lower your pain. These are treatments that you may use at home if they are helpful.

Other treatments and ideas

+ Aromatherapy uses the scent of oils obtained from plants to help you relax or to relieve stress.

+ Meditation focuses your attention to give a clear awareness of your life. You sit quietly, focus on one image or sound,

and breathe deeply.

Yoga uses stretching and exercises (called postures) to reduce stress and improve flexibility and health.

Keep track of your pain in a pain diary. This can help you understand how the things you do affect your pain.

+ Some hospitals have special pain clinics or centers. Your doctor may refer you to a pain clinic or center. Or you can
ask your doctor about them.

Instructions (continued)

Surgery is stressful. Stress usually increases before, during, and after surgery. Beforehand, you're probably
a bit nervous. During and after surgery, your body is stressed, trying to heal itself. And unfortunately, stress
makes your body release hormones that make it even more difficult than usual to regulate blood glucose.

You may go off your normal meal plan. Often your doctor will give you special instructions about eating
and drinking in the hours before surgery. And for a few days after, you might not eat normally either.
Going away from your meal plan can cause changes to blood glucose levels.

GUIDE TO SKIN CLEANSING BEFORE SURGERY
Before surgery, you can play an important role in your own health. Because skin is not sterile, your skin needs to
be as free of germs as possible before surgery. You can reduce the number of germs on your skin by washing with
Hibiclens. Hibiclens is an antiseptic that kills germs on contact and bonds with the skin to continue killing germs
even after washing. Your Surgeon has ordered this skin cleaning procedure to help prevent infections. Please
follow these instructions carefully.
Please do not use if you have an allergy to chlorhexidine, the active ingredient in Hibiclens.

Date of Surgery: 8/29/23

Shower or Bathe 2 nights before surgery:

ON
8/27/23
8/28/23

1. Use approximately half a bottle of Hibiclens for each bath.

2. If you plan to wash your hair, use your regular shampoo. Rinse well.

3. Wash your face with your regular soap. Rinse well.

4. Apply Hibiclens. Do not get any in your eyes, nose, or ears. Wash thoroughly, from the neck down, paying
special attention to the area where your surgery will be performed. DO NOT use Hibiclens on your head
or genital area. Wash your body gently for 5 minutes. Do not scrub your skin too hard. Rinse thoroughly.

5. Pat dry with a clean towel.

6. DO NOT apply lotions or moisturizers, or powder.

7. If you receive 2 bottles of Hibiclens, keep one for use after surgery.

“Surgical Site

Infections”

What is o Surgical Site Infection (SSI)?
‘Assurgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the
part of the body where the surgery took place. Most patients who have
surgery do not develop an infection. However, infections develop in
about 1 to 3 out of every 100 patients who have surgery.
Some of the common symptoms of a surgical site infection are:

* Redness and pain around the area where you had surgery

* Drainage of cloudy fluid from your surgical wound

* Fever

Can SSis be treated?

Yes, Most surgical site infections can be treated with antibiotics. The
antibiotic given to you depends on the bacteria (germs) causing the
infection. Sometimes patients with SSis also need another surgery to
treat the infection.

What are some of the things that hospitals are doing to prevent SSis?
To prevent SSis, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers:
* Clean their hands and arms up to their elbows with an antiseptic

agent just before the surgery.

‘+ Clean their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
rub before and after caring for each patient.

+ May remove some of your hair immediately before your surgery
using electric clippers ifthe hair isin the same area where the pro-
cedure will occur. They should not shave you with a razor.

* Wear special hair covers, masks, gowns, and gloves during surgery
to keep the surgery area clean.

* Give you antibiotics before your surgery starts. In most cases, you
should get antibiotics within 60 minutes before the surgery starts
and the antibiotics should be stopped within 24 hours after surgery.

‘+ Clean the skin at the site of your surgery with a special soap that
kills germs.

What can | do to help prevent SSis?

Before your surgery:
* Tell your doctor about other medical problems you may have.
Health problems such as allergies, diabetes, and obesity could af-
fect your surgery and your treatment.

Printed on 9/30/24 10:58 AM

* Quit smoking. Patients who smoke get more infections. Talk to your
doctor about how you can quit before your surgery.

* Do not shave near where you will have surgery. Shaving with a razor
an irritate your skin and make it easier to develop an infection.

At the time of your surgery:

‘+ Speak up if someone tries to shave you with a razor before surgery.
‘Ask why you need to be shaved and talk with your surgeon if you have
any concerns.

** Ask if you will get antibiotics before surgery.

After your surgery:

+ Make sure that your healthcare providers clean their hands before
‘examining you, either with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
rub.

If you do not hand

‘* Family and friends who visit you should not touch the surgical wound
or dressings.

‘+ Family and friends should clean their hands with soap and water or an
alcohol-based hand rub before and after visiting you. If you do not see
them clean their hands, ask them to clean their hands.

What do | need to do when | go home from the hospital?

* Before you go home, your doctor or nurse should explain everything
you need to know about taking care of your wound. Make sure you
understand how to care for your wound before you leave the hospital.

* Always clean your hands before and after caring for your wound.

* Before you go home, make sure you know who to contact if you have
questions or problems after you get home.

* If you have any symptoms of an infection, such as redness and pain at
the surgery site, drainage, or fever, call your doctor immediately.

If you have additional questions, please ask your doctor or nurse.

Developing a Pain Management Plan: After Your Visit

Your Care Instructions

Some diseases and injuries can cause pain that lasts a long time. You don't need to live with uncontrolled pain. A pain
management plan helps you find ways to control pain with side effects you can live with.

There are things you can do to help with pain. Only you know how much pain you feel. Constant pain can make you
depressed. It can cause stress and make it hard for you to eat and sleep. But there are ways to control the pain. They can
help you stay active, improve your mood, and heal faster.

Your plan can include many types of pain control. You may take prescription or over-the-counter drugs. You can also try
physical treatments and behavioral methods. Some medical treatments also help with pain. For example, radiation can be
used to reduce pain from bone cancer.

You and your doctor will work to make your plan. Be sure to read it often. Change it if your pain is not under control.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?
Physical treatments

+ Be safe with medicines. Take pain medicines exactly as directed.
e If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it exactly as prescribed. Recording the times you took
medicine may help you ensure medication is taken as prescribed.
© If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.
+ If your pain medicine causes side effects such as constipation or nausea, you may need to take other medicines for
those problems. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you have.

Behavioral treatments

Biofeedback teaches you to control a body function that you normally don't think about. These are things like skin
temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. At first, you will use a machine to give you feedback on the function you
want to control. Then a therapist will teach you what to do next. Over time, you can stop using the machine.

+ Breathing techniques can help you relax and get rid of tension.

Guided imagery is a series of thoughts and images that can focus your attention away from your pain. When you do
it, you use all your senses to help your body respond as though what you are imagining is real.

Hypnosis is a state of focused concentration that makes you less aware of your surroundings. It may cause your brain
to release chemicals that relieve pain. You can have a therapist help you through hypnosis. Or you can learn to use it
‘on yourself.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of counseling. It helps you change your thought patterns. Changes in your
thoughts can help change your behavior and the way you perceive your body.

positioning, repositioning, using blankets or pillows, or pillows to splint area of pain, using security objects, cool
cloth, decreasing distractions or lowering the lighting, family presence, minimizing unnecessary movement, music, or
verbalization. Play therapy, rocking, and swaddling, may help infants and children. Some of these may have worked

Instructions (continued)

Surgery is stressful. Stress usually increases before, during, and after surgery. Beforehand, you're probably
a bit nervous. During and after surgery, your body is stressed, trying to heal itself. And unfortunately, stress
makes your body release hormones that make it even more difficult than usual to regulate blood glucose.

You may go off your normal meal plan. Often your doctor will give you special instructions about eating
and drinking in the hours before surgery. And for a few days after, you might not eat normally either.
Going away from your meal plan can cause changes to blood glucose levels.

Your medication routine may change temporarily. Depending on what type you take, you may need to
switch to a different medication, or adjust your dose as instructed by your physician.

Continuous glucose monitoring devices. If you wear a continuous glucose monitoring device such as a
Dexcom or Libre, this device will need to be removed before going into the operating room for safety
purposes. Please make plans accordingly. You may contact the device company for a replacement if
required to remove early due to surgery.

INSTRUCTIONS:
+ The day and evening prior to surgery, maintain your usual meal plan and insulin dose and/or oral diabetic
medications.

If you take insulin,

° Check your fingerstick blood glucose at bedtime.
° If your blood glucose is greater than 180, take your insulin according to your normal routine.
Remember, you are not going to be eating or drinking anything after midnight.

If you become hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) treat with glucose gel. Be sure to tell the nurse on arrival to
surgery that you were hypoglycemic.

On the morning of surgery before coming to the hospital take this dose of insulin: NONE

DO NOT take ANY of these oral or injectable diabetic medications, Byetta, Bydureon, Victoza, Trulicity, and
Rybelsus or any other GLP1 drugs, or any short acting insulin (Novolog, Humalog, Apidra, or Regular) on the
morning of surgery.

The Nurse will check your blood sugar when you get to the hospital and throughout your stay.

GUIDE TO SKIN CLEANSING BEFORE SURGERY
Before surgery, you can play an important role in your own health. Because skin is not sterile, your skin needs to
be as free of germs as possible before surgery. You can reduce the number of germs on your skin by washing with
Hibiclens. Hibiclens is an antiseptic that kills germs on contact and bonds with the skin to continue killing germs
even after washing. Your Surgeon has ordered this skin cleaning procedure to help prevent infections. Please
follow these instructions carefully.
Please do not use if you have an allergy to chlorhexidine, the active ingredient in Hibiclens.

Date of Surgery: 8/29/23

Shower or Bathe 2 nights before surgery:

ON
8/27/23
8/28/23

1. Use approximately half a bottle of Hibiclens for each bath.

2. If you plan to wash your hair, use your regular shampoo. Rinse well.

3. Wash your face with your regular soap. Rinse well.

4. Apply Hibiclens. Do not get any in your eyes, nose, or ears. Wash thoroughly, from the neck down, paying
special attention to the area where your surgery will be performed. DO NOT use Hibiclens on your head
or genital area. Wash your body gently for 5 minutes. Do not scrub your skin too hard. Rinse thoroughly.

5. Pat dry with a clean towel.

6. DO NOT apply lotions or moisturizers, or powder.

7. If you receive 2 bottles of Hibiclens, keep one for use after surgery.

“Surgical Site

Infections”

What is o Surgical Site Infection (SSI)?
‘Assurgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the
part of the body where the surgery took place. Most patients who have
surgery do not develop an infection. However, infections develop in
about 1 to 3 out of every 100 patients who have surgery.
Some of the common symptoms of a surgical site infection are:

* Redness and pain around the area where you had surgery

* Drainage of cloudy fluid from your surgical wound

* Fever

Can SSis be treated?

Yes, Most surgical site infections can be treated with antibiotics. The
antibiotic given to you depends on the bacteria (germs) causing the
infection. Sometimes patients with SSis also need another surgery to
treat the infection.

What are some of the things that hospitals are doing to prevent SSis?
To prevent SSis, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers:
* Clean their hands and arms up to their elbows with an antiseptic

agent just before the surgery.

‘+ Clean their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
rub before and after caring for each patient.

+ May remove some of your hair immediately before your surgery
using electric clippers ifthe hair isin the same area where the pro-
cedure will occur. They should not shave you with a razor.

* Wear special hair covers, masks, gowns, and gloves during surgery
to keep the surgery area clean.

* Give you antibiotics before your surgery starts. In most cases, you
should get antibiotics within 60 minutes before the surgery starts
and the antibiotics should be stopped within 24 hours after surgery.

‘+ Clean the skin at the site of your surgery with a special soap that
kills germs.

What can | do to help prevent SSis?

Before your surgery:
* Tell your doctor about other medical problems you may have.
Health problems such as allergies, diabetes, and obesity could af-
fect your surgery and your treatment.

any concerns.

+ Make sure that your healthcare providers clean their hands before
‘examining you, either with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
rub.

If you do not hand

‘* Family and friends who visit you should not touch the surgical wound
or dressings.

‘+ Family and friends should clean their hands with soap and water or an
alcohol-based hand rub before and after visiting you. If you do not see
them clean their hands, ask them to clean their hands.

What do | need to do when | go home from the hospital?

* Before you go home, your doctor or nurse should explain everything
you need to know about taking care of your wound. Make sure you
understand how to care for your wound before you leave the hospital.

* Always clean your hands before and after caring for your wound.

* Before you go home, make sure you know who to contact if you have
questions or problems after you get home.

* If you have any symptoms of an infection, such as redness and pain at
the surgery site, drainage, or fever, call your doctor immediately.

If you have additional questions, please ask your doctor or nurse.

Developing a Pain Management Plan: After Your Visit

Your Care Instructions

Some diseases and injuries can cause pain that lasts a long time. You don't need to live with uncontrolled pain. A pain
management plan helps you find ways to control pain with side effects you can live with.

There are things you can do to help with pain. Only you know how much pain you feel. Constant pain can make you
depressed. It can cause stress and make it hard for you to eat and sleep. But there are ways to control the pain. They can
help you stay active, improve your mood, and heal faster.

Your plan can include many types of pain control. You may take prescription or over-the-counter drugs. You can also try
physical treatments and behavioral methods. Some medical treatments also help with pain. For example, radiation can be
used to reduce pain from bone cancer.

You and your doctor will work to make your plan. Be sure to read it often. Change it if your pain is not under control.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?
Physical treatments

+ Be safe with medicines. Take pain medicines exactly as directed.
° If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it exactly as prescribed. Recording the times you took
medicine may help you ensure medication is taken as prescribed.
° If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.
+ If your pain medicine causes side effects such as constipation or nausea, you may need to take other medicines for
those problems. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you have.

Behavioral treatments

Biofeedback teaches you to control a body function that you normally don't think about. These are things like skin
temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. At first, you will use a machine to give you feedback on the function you
want to control. Then a therapist will teach you what to do next. Over time, you can stop using the machine.

+ Breathing techniques can help you relax and get rid of tension.

Guided imagery is a series of thoughts and images that can focus your attention away from your pain. When you do
it, you use all your senses to help your body respond as though what you are imagining is real.

Hypnosis is a state of focused concentration that makes you less aware of your surroundings. It may cause your brain
to release chemicals that relieve pain. You can have a therapist help you through hypnosis. Or you can learn to use it
‘on yourself.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of counseling. It helps you change your thought patterns. Changes in your
thoughts can help change your behavior and the way you perceive your body.

Other non-medicine treatments from the hospital

+ In the hospital, you may have experienced some non-medicine comfort treatments such as: deep breathing,
positioning, repositioning, using blankets or pillows, or pillows to splint area of pain, using security objects, cool
cloth, decreasing distractions or lowering the lighting, family presence, minimizing unnecessary movement, music, or
verbalization. Play therapy, rocking, and swaddling, may help infants and children. Some of these may have worked
to control or lower your pain. These are treatments that you may use at home if they are helpful.

Other treatments and ideas

+ Aromatherapy uses the scent of oils obtained from plants to help you relax or to relieve stress.

+ Meditation focuses your attention to give a clear awareness of your life. You sit quietly, focus on one image or sound,
and breathe deeply.

+ Yoga uses stretching and exercises (called postures) to reduce stress and improve flexibility and health.

+ Keep track of your pain in a pain diary. This can help you understand how the things you do affect your pain.

+ Some hospitals have special pain clinics or centers. Your doctor may refer you to a pain clinic or center. Or you can
ask your doctor about them.

Summary

Noncontrast study.

Suboptimal Doppler signal for aortic valve gradient assessment. Consider a limited
echo study with contrast or invasive

hemodynamic assessment for aortic valve pressure gradient as clinically directed.
Normal left ventricular size. There is moderate concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low-normal with an EF between 50-55%,
estimated visually.

Hypokinesis in apical septal and true apex segments.

Grade II diastolic dysfunction (moderate increase in filling pressures).

Right ventricle is normal in size and systolic function.

Mild pulmonary hypertension.

The IVC is normal in size with greater than 50% collapse with inspiration.

There is no significant pericardial effusion.

Compared to prior 2020 study, suboptimal Doppler signal for aortic valve gradient
assessment. Consider a limited echo study

with contrast or invasive hemodynamic assessment for aortic valve pressure
gradient as clinically directed. Aortic stenosis was

moderate in prior study with peak velocity of 3.6 ms and mean gradient of 32 mmHg.
Compared to prior study, LV function

appears low normal with wall motion abnormality in apical septal and true apex
segments. Consider a limited echo study with

contrast for LV function assessment/RWMA as Clinically directed.

Discharge Diagnoses: Stage D1 severe aortic stenosis s/p TAVR

Discharge Condition: Stable

Structural Cardiologist: John Schindler, MD
Cardiac Surgeon: James Greelish, MD
Primary Cardiologist: John Schindler, MD

Brief HPI: Lawrence Kitchin was previously followed by Dr. Amish Sura in Structural Clinic for evaluation of severe
aortic stenosis. He was initially seen during hospitalization 3/29/2019. Lawrence Kitchin was initially seen by Dr.
Schindler in our clinic on 7/27/2023. Patient's most recent echocardiogram and past history were reviewed. Patient
reported they were having the following symptoms: SOB, dizziness, lightheadedness and progressive of symptoms
over past 12 months. Patient underwent preprocedure testing including CTA chest abdomen pelvis, carotid US, PFTs
and heart catheterization. Lawrence Kitchin was seen by Alec Akbarov, MD on 8/15/2023 and felt to be an
appropriate candidate for TAVR. Lawrence Kitchin was presented to our Structural Heart Team on 8/16/2023 and also
felt to be an appropriate candidate for TAVR.

Operative Course: On 8/30/2023 Lawrence Kitchin underwent TAVR procedure with a 29 mm Medtronic Evolut
fracture bioprosthesis by right transfemoral approach with postimplantation dilation of the transcatheter heart valve
with 23 mm x 4.cm ZMED balloon. TTE post implant revealed EF 55 to 60%, aortic valve mean gradient 5 mmHg,
trace to mild PVL. The procedure was performed under MAC. They tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to CVICU in stable condition.

Hospital Course:
After being transferred to the CVICU the patient was started on core measures. EKG in CVICU revealed sinus rhythm

with first-degree AV block, 60 bpm, PRI 242 ms, QRS 88 ms. He did have some mild oozing from the right femoral
groin site upon arrival to CVICU that resolved with additional manual pressure to the right groin with hemostasis
achieved. POD#1 2-D echo was performed with noted TAVR valve seated in good position, preserved EF, mild PVL,
MG 5. POD #1 EKG revealed sinus bradycardia 1st degree block, PRI 252ms, QRS 90ms. Complications: None.
Preprocedure hemoglobin 11.6, postprocedure 9.4, POD1 9.4. The patient is ambulating and they have been referred
to cardiac rehab. At this time they are deemed acceptable for discharge to home.

| agree with the findings as outlined by ACP Harris. | have performed an independent evaluation. | have personally
reviewed the imaging studies to include today's TTE. The patient is a pleasant 70 76-year-old male who is
postoperative day 1 from a transfemoral TAVR (29 mm EVOLUT prosthesis). He is pleased to report that he feels
significantly better this AM. On exam, he is bradycardic, normotensive and euvolemic. His electrocardiogram reveals
a sinus bradycardia with first-degree AV block and a narrow QRS complex. His transthoracic echocardiogram reveals
excellent bioprosthetic valve function. He will discontinue his nadolol, furosemide and aspirin therapy. He will remain
on Plavix due to the recent implantation of the transcatheter heart valve and Aldactone therapy for his cirrhosis. He
will follow-up in 2 weeks time for a repeat assessment at which time cardiac rehab will be recommended.

CARDIAC REHAB EDUCATION PACKET

What does cardiac rehab involve?
Cardiac rehabilitation doesn’t change your past, but it can help you improve your heart’s
future.

Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program designed to improve your cardiovascular
health if you have experienced heart attack, heart failure, angioplasty, stents or heart
surgery. Cardiac rehab has three equally important parts:

1. Exercise counseling and training: Exercise gets your heart pumping and your entire
cardiovascular system working. You'll learn how to get your body moving in ways
that promote heart health.

2. Education for heart-healthy living: A key element of cardiac rehab is educating
yourself: How can you manage your risk factors? Quit smoking? Make heart-healthy
nutrition choices?

3. Counseling to reduce stress: Stress hurts your heart. This part of cardiac rehab
helps you identify and tackle everyday sources of stress.

RISK FACTORS:

e What does the term Risk Factor mean? Something that increases risk or susceptibility

e What is Coronary Artery Disease? Plaque builds up in your arteries faster than normal and reduces the blood
flow to the heart muscle.

e What are your UN-MODIFIABLE Risk Factors (things that are out of your control)?
Family History

Age

Male

Female post menopause

e What are your MODIFIABLE cardiac risk factors (things that are in your control)? (target goals are below)
o SMOKING (within the past 12 months)

o HYPERLIPIDEMIA ( Dyslipidemia - High levels of cholesterol )

Change can be difficult, but improving your diet and lifestyle is an important part of treating heart disease.
Recent research suggests that the overall diet is more important than a focus on specific foods. Moderation
is the key. When you begin cardiac rehab, you'll be able to schedule an appointment with the dietitian to
develop an individualized plan to meet your goals. Meanwhile, use these tips below to get started.

Eat more vegetables and fruits. Vegetables and fruits are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber. They
are generally low in calories and rich in dietary fiber. Aim for 2 cups of vegetables and 1 cup of fruit each day.
e Choose:
e Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits, without added salt, sauces or sugar.
e Low-sodium or no salt added canned vegetables. (if fresh or frozen are not available)
e Canned fruits packed in juice or water.

Choose whole grain breads and cereals. Whole grains are good sources of fiber and vitamins. They also
provide carbohydrates for energy. Aim for 5 to 7 ’2-cup servings a day.
e Choose:
100% whole wheat bread or whole grain with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice.
High fiber cereal with 3 or more grams of fiber per serving.
Brown rice and whole grain pasta.
Oatmeal
Whole grain crackers and light popcorn.

Go lean with protein. Protein sources include chicken, fish, meats, milk and milk products, nuts, eggs and
dried beans like pintos, kidney beans, etc. We need 6 ounces of lean protein each day and 2 to 3 servings
of low-fat dairy products.
e Choose:
e = =Skim or 1% milk.
e Fish/seafood — especially salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel or sardines. Shrimp and other shellfish in
moderation.
Skinless chicken or turkey.
Lean beef and pork.
Eggs and egg substitutes. Recommendations are to limit to 2 to 4 egg yolks a week.
Nuts. (Unsalted)

Lose the saltshaker. A diet high in sodium/salt can increase your blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease.
Most people get 3-4 times the recommended amount of sodium.
e Choose:
e Herbs and spices for seasoning; Look for salt-free seasoning blends.
e Mrs. Dash products and other low-sodium seasoning
e Reduced-sodium condiments.
e No-sodium beef and chicken bouillon.

Preparation makes a difference.

e Bake, broil, grill, steam or stir-fry foods. Avoid deep-fat fried foods and foods with added fats and sauces.

e Add flavor with herbs and spices, lemon juice and salt-free seasonings such as Mrs. Dash or Herb-Ox No-
Sodium bouillon.

e Do NOT use a salt substitute until you talk with your doctor.

Choose fats wisely. Not all fats are the same. Monounsaturated fats like olive and canola oil and polyunsaturated
fats like corn oil and other vegetable oils are more heart healthy. All fats are high in calories.

Clinical Notes (continued)
e Choose:
e Olive and canola oils
e Trans-fat free margarine.
e Cooking spray
e Low-fat mayo and salad dressings

e Eating out. If you eat out or order takeout meals several times a week, you need to choose carefully.
e Plan ahead. Check out restaurant web sites for nutrition information.
e Ask for low-fat, lighter fare entrees or heart healthy options.
e Atsalad bars select raw veggies (lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, etc.) instead of marinated
salads and meat. Skip the cheese and bacon bits. Use a small amount of salad dressing.
e Choose whole grain breads and crackers instead of biscuits.

e Reading food labels. Food labels are a great tool to help you make heart healthy changes. Reading labels when
grocery shopping can be time consuming. Choose two or three items to look at each time you shop. Make a note
of the best products to meet your goals and add them to your grocery list.

e Look first at the serving size. All information is based on the serving size.
e Choose lower fat and lower sodium foods.

e If you want to lose weight, compare the calories in similar foods.

e If you have diabetes, look at the Total Carbohydrates before buying.

e Maintain or achieve a healthy weight. Being overweight is a risk factor for heart disease. Losing 5 to 10 percent
of your current weight can have significant health benefits. The key is to eat less and move more.
e Reduce your portion sizes and skip second helpings.
e Pay attention to your hunger cues. Don't eat out of boredom or to relieve stress.
e Rethink your drink. Calories from sweet tea, regular sodas, specialty coffees and alcoholic drinks add up
quickly.

e Practice Moderation. A heart healthy diet is about balance. Allow yourself an indulgence occasionally. Don't let it
turn into an excuse for giving up on your heart healthy eating plan.

¢ Getting started. Think of the changes you need to make as a journey.

e Choose one or two changes you want to work on. Maybe you will switch from 2% milk to 1% milk and limit fried
foods to once a month. Perhaps you will work on eating more vegetables and drinking fewer sodas. In a couple
of weeks, try to make another change.

e Keep a food diary. Record everything you eat including the measured amounts. You can use paper and pencil,
or a phone app such as “My Fitness Pal.”

WHAT IS CARDIAC REHAB?

e Cardiac rehabilitation doesn't change your past, but it can help you improve your hearts future.

e Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program designed to improve your cardiovascular health if you have
experienced heart attack, heart failure, angioplasty, stent or heart surgery. Cardiac rehab has three equally
important parts:

1. Exercise counseling and training: Exercise gets your heart pumping and your entire cardiovascular

Anesthesia Type:
Monitored Anesthetic Care

Indication: The patient is a(n) 76 y.o. with significant symptomatic aortic stenosis. The patient underwent evaluation in
our Structural Heart clinic and was evaluated by the heart team who agreed that TAVR was indicated. Appropriate
valve size and perifpheral access were determined with CTA analysis preoperatively.

Procedure Details

The patient was seen in the holding room, identified and the history and physical was reviewed and updated. The
risks, benefits, complications, treatment options and expected outcome were previously discussed in the clinic and
specifically included the risk of death, stroke, bleeding, infection, heart attack, reoperation, graft/valve failure, need for
permanent pacemaker and need and risk of blood transfusion were previously discussed. At that time and in the
holding area the patient was given the chance to ask questions and all questions were answered. The patient
demonstrated understanding of the procedure, the non-surgical options and the risks associated with the procedure
and subsequently consented with the proposed operative plan. The site of surgery was properly noted/marked as per
hospital policy. The patient was then taken to the hybrid operating room, identified and the procedure verified during
the time out.

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

SEDATION and Imaging:
MAC (Monitored Anesthesia Care) Sedation and TTE were used.

PACEMAKER

FEMORAL VENOUS

Right KX] Left common femoral venous access was obtained during the case using the micropuncture kit and up-
sized to a 6F sheath was inserted into the femoral vein.

XA temporary transvenous pacemaker was then advanced via the femoral venous sheath into the right ventricle.
Once we were satisfied with its location and function it was secured into position.

TAVR ACCESS

A 5F micropuncture kit was used (with ultrasound guidance) to obtain access to the femoral artery to be used for
TAVR access. This was then up-sized to a 6 F sheath.

An angiogram was performed through the sheath confirming good location and no apparent complication.

One Per-Close devices was placed in the TAVR access site with the at the 12 o'clock positions over the J-tipped wire.

An 8F sheath was then inserted into the TAVR femoral artery.

NON-TAVR ACCESS

In the contralateral groin, non-TAVR femoral arterial access was obtained using a 5 French (F) micropuncture kit with
fluoroscopic guidance followed by placement of a 5F sheath.

A 5F straight pigtail catheter was advanced to the aortic root and positioned into the base of the NON coronary cusp.
A series of angiograms with dilute dye was then performed at the implant angle (pre-determined from CTA) to obtain

the optimal co-planar view. This position was stored. The pigtail catheter was then pulled back into the ascending
aorta.

SHEATH PLACEMENT

Heparin was administered to achieve an ACT > 300 sec.

A Xl 12F im 14F im 18F Medtronic Sentrant/ Gore Dry-Seal sheath was then advanced into the TAVR femoral artery
over the J tipped Guidewire.

CROSSING AORTIC VALVE
A 5F AL1 catheter was then advanced over the J wire to the aortic root.

The J wire was then removed and a straight guide wire was used to cross the aortic valve.

The AL1 catheter was then advanced across the aortic valve. he straight wire was removed and a J-tipped guide wire
was advanced across the aortic valve.

This catheter was then removed and replaced with a 5F angled pigtail catheter.
Simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures were then recorded revealing a mean gradient of

A pre-shaped stiff guidewire Safari was then placed through the pigtail catheter in the left ventricle. The angled pigtail
was removed.

The Medtronic Core Valve was loaded onto the delivery system. The valve was now inspected under fluoro to ensure
proper loading.

The straight pigtail catheter was then advanced to the non-coronary cusp and used as a surrogate marker of the aortic
annular level.

the EVOLUT valve with in-line sheath was advanced over the stiff guide wire into the TAVR femoral artery. With
delivery system port at 3 O'clock the device was then advanced up and across the aortic arch and across the native
aortic valve in the co-planar view carefully monitoring the capsule and nose cone.

Parallax was removed from the valve.

We confirmed that the blood pressure was suitable for deployment. The valve was then deployed using controlled
pacing (90-140 bpm)..

Once satisfied with the position of annular contact the remainder of the valve was deployed more rapidly until 80% of
the valve frame was exposed and the valve was fully functrional. At 80% deployment, with the blood pressure
recovered, the parallax on the valve inflow was removed to better determine the valve position relative to the annulus.

Once we were satisfied with the valve location and function the pigtail catheter was pulled back and we deployed the
valve completely. Tension in the system was released slowly to avoid valve movement by retracting the guidewire
slightly while pushing slightly forward on the delivery system and turning the deployment knob on the device to allow
detachment of the two paddles independently.

Confirmation of the paddle deployment was performed with fluoro. The valve was "neutrolized" with the device coaxial
with the inflow portion of the bioprosthesis, the delivery system was withdrawn to the descending aorta. We re-
approximated the nose cone to the delivery catheter.

REPLACEMENT OF SHEATH
The delivery system was then removed over the wire while maintaining position of the wire in the left ventricle.

[X] Pressure was held on the femoral artery. The sheath was then inserted into the femoral artery to achieve
hemostasis.

An angled pigtail catheter was then re-introduced into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressure tracings were obtained
a second time and the new diastolic separation between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings and peak to
peak pressures recorded.

The second pigtail catheter was then used to perform an aortogram for assessment of the valve placement and
paravalvular leaks. Echo was also used to assess the bioprosthesis for function, position, and paravalvular leaks.
Trivial [X] mild [_] moderate [_] severe paravalvular leak was seen. The valve was felt to be in good position relative to
the annulus.

The pigtail catheter was removed from the TAVR femoral artery leaving the wire in place.

POST-DILATION

XJ POST-DILATION: Due to significant paravalvular leak, post-dilation of the bioprosthesis was necessary. We then
prepped the 24 mm Z-Med balloon to mm. We replaced the left ventricular wire with the TAVR stiff wire. We rapidly
paced and the valve was post-dilated.

An angled pigtail catheter was then re-introduced into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressure tracings were obtained
and the diastolic separation between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings recorded. A repeat angiogram
was performed after pullback of the pigtail catheter for assessment of the valve placement and paravalvular leaks.

XX] trace L] moderate [_] severe paravalvular leak was seen. The valve was in good position relative to the annulus.

SHEATH REMOVAL AND ACCESS CLOSURE

The TAVR access sheath was then removed over a J-tipped guidewire, and hemostasis was achieved by advancing
the Perclose knot to the arteriotomy site.

Protamine was administered. The J-tipped guide wire was removed and an 8F Angioseal device was placed. The
knot for the Perclose devices was locked and the suture was cut at the arteriotomy site.

The alternative access (non-TAVR) site was closed with a 6F Angio-Seal vascular closure device after an angiogram
documented access in the CFA.

Indication: The patient is a(n) 76 y.o. with significant symptomatic aortic stenosis. The patient underwent evaluation in
our Structural Heart clinic and was evaluated by the heart team who agreed that TAVR was indicated. Appropriate
valve size and perifpheral access were determined with CTA analysis preoperatively.

Procedure Details

The patient was seen in the holding room, identified and the history and physical was reviewed and updated. The
risks, benefits, complications, treatment options and expected outcome were previously discussed in the clinic and
specifically included the risk of death, stroke, bleeding, infection, heart attack, reoperation, graft/valve failure, need for
permanent pacemaker and need and risk of blood transfusion were previously discussed. At that time and in the
holding area the patient was given the chance to ask questions and all questions were answered. The patient
demonstrated understanding of the procedure, the non-surgical options and the risks associated with the procedure
and subsequently consented with the proposed operative plan. The site of surgery was properly noted/marked as per
hospital policy. The patient was then taken to the hybrid operating room, identified and the procedure verified during
the time out.

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

SEDATION and Imaging:
MAC (Monitored Anesthesia Care) Sedation and TTE were used.

our Structural Heart clinic and was evaluated by the heart team who agreed that TAVR was indicated. Appropriate
valve size and perifpheral access were determined with CTA analysis preoperatively.

Procedure Details

The patient was seen in the holding room, identified and the history and physical was reviewed and updated. The
risks, benefits, complications, treatment options and expected outcome were previously discussed in the clinic and
specifically included the risk of death, stroke, bleeding, infection, heart attack, reoperation, graft/valve failure, need for
permanent pacemaker and need and risk of blood transfusion were previously discussed. At that time and in the
holding area the patient was given the chance to ask questions and all questions were answered. The patient
demonstrated understanding of the procedure, the non-surgical options and the risks associated with the procedure
and subsequently consented with the proposed operative plan. The site of surgery was properly noted/marked as per
hospital policy. The patient was then taken to the hybrid operating room, identified and the procedure verified during
the time out.

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

SEDATION and Imaging:
MAC (Monitored Anesthesia Care) Sedation and TTE were used.

PACEMAKER

FEMORAL VENOUS

Right KX] Left common femoral venous access was obtained during the case using the micropuncture kit and up-
sized to a 6F sheath was inserted into the femoral vein.

Once we were satisfied with its location and function it was secured into position.

JA temporary transvenous pacemaker was then advanced via the femoral venous sheath into the right ventricle.

TAVR ACCESS

A 5F micropuncture kit was used (with ultrasound guidance) to obtain access to the femoral artery to be used for
TAVR access. This was then up-sized to a 6 F sheath.

An angiogram was performed through the sheath confirming good location and no apparent complication.
One Per-Close devices was placed in the TAVR access site with the at the 12 o'clock positions over the J-tipped wire.

An 8F sheath was then inserted into the TAVR femoral artery.

NON-TAVR ACCESS

In the contralateral groin, non-TAVR femoral arterial access was obtained using a 5 French (F) micropuncture kit with
fluoroscopic guidance followed by placement of a 5F sheath.

A 5F straight pigtail catheter was advanced to the aortic root and positioned into the base of the NON coronary cusp.

A series of angiograms with dilute dye was then performed at the implant angle (pre-determined from CTA) to obtain
the optimal co-planar view. This position was stored. The pigtail catheter was then pulled back into the ascending

SHEATH PLACEMENT

Heparin was administered to achieve an ACT > 300 sec.

A&]12F ]14F[(]18F Medtronic Sentrant/ Gore Dry-Seal sheath was then advanced into the TAVR femoral artery
over the J tipped Guidewire.

CROSSING AORTIC VALVE

A 5F AL1 catheter was then advanced over the J wire to the aortic root.
The J wire was then removed and a straight guide wire was used to cross the aortic valve.

The AL1 catheter was then advanced across the aortic valve. he straight wire was removed and a J-tipped guide wire
was advanced across the aortic valve.

This catheter was then removed and replaced with a 5F angled pigtail catheter.
Simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures were then recorded revealing a mean gradient of

A pre-shaped stiff guidewire Safari was then placed through the pigtail catheter in the left ventricle. The angled pigtail
was removed.

The Medtronic Core Valve was loaded onto the delivery system. The valve was now inspected under fluoro to ensure
proper loading.

The straight pigtail catheter was then advanced to the non-coronary cusp and used as a surrogate marker of the aortic
annular level.

VALVE PLACEMENT

XX] The Sentrant/Gore Dry Seal sheath in the TAVR femoral artery was then removed, and pressure temporarily held to
achieve hemostasis while

the EVOLUT valve with in-line sheath was advanced over the stiff guide wire into the TAVR femoral artery. With
delivery system port at 3 O'clock the device was then advanced up and across the aortic arch and across the native
aortic valve in the co-planar view carefully monitoring the capsule and nose cone.

Parallax was removed from the valve.

We confirmed that the blood pressure was suitable for deployment. The valve was then deployed using controlled
pacing (90-140 bpm)..

Once satisfied with the position of annular contact the remainder of the valve was deployed more rapidly until 80% of
the valve frame was exposed and the valve was fully functrional. At 80% deployment, with the blood pressure
recovered, the parallax on the valve inflow was removed to better determine the valve position relative to the annulus.

Once we were satisfied with the valve location and function the pigtail catheter was pulled back and we deployed the
valve completely. Tension in the system was released slowly to avoid valve movement by retracting the guidewire
slightly while pushing slightly forward on the delivery system and turning the deployment knob on the device to allow

detachment of the two paddles independently.

Confirmation of the paddle deployment was performed with fluoro. The valve was "neutrolized" with the device coaxial
with the inflow portion of the bioprosthesis, the delivery system was withdrawn to the descending aorta. We re-
approximated the nose cone to the delivery catheter.

REPLACEMENT OF SHEATH
The delivery system was then removed over the wire while maintaining position of the wire in the left ventricle.

[X] Pressure was held on the femoral artery. The sheath was then inserted into the femoral artery to achieve
hemostasis.

An angled pigtail catheter was then re-introduced into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressure tracings were obtained
a second time and the new diastolic separation between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings and peak to
peak pressures recorded.

The second pigtail catheter was then used to perform an aortogram for assessment of the valve placement and
paravalvular leaks. Echo was also used to assess the bioprosthesis for function, position, and paravalvular leaks.
Trivial [X] mild [] moderate L] severe paravalvular leak was seen. The valve was felt to be in good position relative to
the annulus.

The pigtail catheter was removed from the TAVR femoral artery leaving the wire in place.

POST-DILATION

XX] POST-DILATION: Due to significant paravalvular leak, post-dilation of the bioprosthesis was necessary. We then
prepped the 24 mm Z-Med balloon to mm. We replaced the left ventricular wire with the TAVR stiff wire. We rapidly
paced and the valve was post-dilated.

An angled pigtail catheter was then re-introduced into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressure tracings were obtained
and the diastolic separation between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings recorded. A repeat angiogram
was performed after pullback of the pigtail catheter for assessment of the valve placement and paravalvular leaks.

XX] trace L] moderate __] severe paravalvular leak was seen. The valve was in good position relative to the annulus.
The pigtail catheter were removed from the TAVR femoral artery.

SHEATH REMOVAL AND ACCESS CLOSURE

The TAVR access sheath was then removed over a J-tipped guidewire, and hemostasis was achieved by advancing
the Perclose knot to the arteriotomy site.

Protamine was administered. The J-tipped guide wire was removed and an 8F Angioseal device was placed. The
knot for the Perclose devices was locked and the suture was cut at the arteriotomy site.

The alternative access (non-TAVR) site was closed with a 6F Angio-Seal vascular closure device after an angiogram
documented access in the CFA.

Anesthesiologist:
Anesthesiologist: Salameh, Nabil Peter, MD
CRNA: Black, Ekaterina, CRNA

Anesthesia Type:
Monitored Anesthetic Care

Indication: The patient is a(n) 76 y.o. with significant symptomatic aortic stenosis. The patient underwent evaluation in
our Structural Heart clinic and was evaluated by the heart team who agreed that TAVR was indicated. Appropriate
valve size and perifpheral access were determined with CTA analysis preoperatively.

Procedure Details

The patient was seen in the holding room, identified and the history and physical was reviewed and updated. The
risks, benefits, complications, treatment options and expected outcome were previously discussed in the clinic and
specifically included the risk of death, stroke, bleeding, infection, heart attack, reoperation, graft/valve failure, need for
permanent pacemaker and need and risk of blood transfusion were previously discussed. At that time and in the
holding area the patient was given the chance to ask questions and all questions were answered. The patient
demonstrated understanding of the procedure, the non-surgical options and the risks associated with the procedure
and subsequently consented with the proposed operative plan. The site of surgery was properly noted/marked as per
hospital policy. The patient was then taken to the hybrid operating room, identified and the procedure verified during
the time out.

The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

SEDATION and Imaging:
MAC (Monitored Anesthesia Care) Sedation and TTE were used.

PACEMAKER

FEMORAL VENOUS

Right XX] Left common femoral venous access was obtained during the case using the micropuncture kit and up-
sized to a 6F sheath was inserted into the femoral vein.

XJA temporary transvenous pacemaker was then advanced via the femoral venous sheath into the right ventricle.
Once we were satisfied with its location and function it was secured into position.

TAVR ACCESS

A 5F micropuncture kit was used (with ultrasound guidance) to obtain access to the femoral artery to be used for
TAVR access. This was then up-sized to a 6 F sheath.

An angiogram was performed through the sheath confirming good location and no apparent complication.

Case 884482 (TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT) (continued)

One Per-Close devices was placed in the TAVR access site with the at the 12 o'clock positions over the J-tipped wire.

An 8F sheath was then inserted into the TAVR femoral artery.

NON-TAVR ACCESS

In the contralateral groin, non-TAVR femoral arterial access was obtained using a 5 French (F) micropuncture kit with
fluoroscopic guidance followed by placement of a 5F sheath.

A 5F straight pigtail catheter was advanced to the aortic root and positioned into the base of the NON coronary cusp.

A series of angiograms with dilute dye was then performed at the implant angle (pre-determined from CTA) to obtain
the optimal co-planar view. This position was stored. The pigtail catheter was then pulled back into the ascending
aorta.

SHEATH PLACEMENT

Heparin was administered to achieve an ACT > 300 sec.

A&12F ]14F[]18F Medtronic Sentrant/ Gore Dry-Seal sheath was then advanced into the TAVR femoral artery
over the J tipped Guidewire.

CROSSING AORTIC VALVE

A 5F AL1 catheter was then advanced over the J wire to the aortic root.
The J wire was then removed and a straight guide wire was used to cross the aortic valve.

The AL1 catheter was then advanced across the aortic valve. he straight wire was removed and a J-tipped guide wire
was advanced across the aortic valve.

This catheter was then removed and replaced with a 5F angled pigtail catheter.
Simultaneous left ventricular and aortic pressures were then recorded revealing a mean gradient of 68 mm Hg

A pre-shaped stiff guidewire Amplatz was then placed through the pigtail catheter in the left ventricle. The angled
pigtail was removed.

The Medtronic Core Valve was loaded onto the delivery system. The valve was now inspected under fluoro to ensure
proper loading.

The straight pigtail catheter was then advanced to the non-coronary cusp and used as a surrogate marker of the aortic
annular level.

VALVE PLACEMENT

The Sentrant/Gore Dry Seal sheath in the TAVR femoral artery was then removed, and pressure temporarily held to
achieve hemostasis while

the EVOLUT valve with in-line sheath was advanced over the stiff guide wire into the TAVR femoral artery. With
delivery system port at 3 O'clock the device was then advanced up and across the aortic arch and across the native

aortic valve in the co-planar view carefully monitoring the capsule and nose cone.
Parallax was removed from the valve.

We confirmed that the blood pressure was suitable for deployment. The valve was then deployed using controlled
pacing (90-140 bpm)..

Once satisfied with the position of annular contact the remainder of the valve was deployed more rapidly until 80% of
the valve frame was exposed and the valve was fully functrional. At 80% deployment, with the blood pressure
recovered, the parallax on the valve inflow was removed to better determine the valve position relative to the annulus.

Once we were satisfied with the valve location and function the pigtail catheter was pulled back and we deployed the
valve completely. Tension in the system was released slowly to avoid valve movement by retracting the guidewire
slightly while pushing slightly forward on the delivery system and turning the deployment knob on the device to allow
detachment of the two paddles independently.

Confirmation of the paddle deployment was performed with fluoro. The valve was "neutrolized" with the device coaxial
with the inflow portion of the bioprosthesis, the delivery system was withdrawn to the descending aorta. We re-
approximated the nose cone to the delivery catheter.

REPLACEMENT OF SHEATH
The delivery system was then removed over the wire while maintaining position of the wire in the left ventricle.

[X] Pressure was held on the femoral artery. The sheath was then inserted into the femoral artery to achieve
hemostasis.

An angled pigtail catheter was then re-introduced into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressure tracings were obtained
a second time and the new diastolic separation between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings and peak to
peak pressures recorded.

The pigtail catheter was removed from the TAVR femoral artery leaving the wire in place.

POST-DILATION

XJ POST-DILATION: Due to incomplete expansion of the trans-catheter heart valve, post-dilation of the bioprosthesis
was necessary. We then prepped the 23 mm Z-Med balloon to mm. We replaced the left ventricular wire with the
TAVR stiff wire. We rapidly paced and the valve was post-dilated.

An angled pigtail catheter was then re-introduced into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressure tracings were obtained
and the diastolic separation between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings recorded. A repeat angiogram
was performed after pullback of the pigtail catheter for assessment of the valve placement and paravalvular leaks.

XX trace [1 moderate _] severe paravalvular leak was seen. The valve was in good position relative to the annulus.
The pigtail catheter were removed from the TAVR femoral artery.

The second pigtail catheter was then used to perform an aortogram for assessment of the valve placement and
paravalvular leaks. Echo was also used to assess the bioprosthesis for function, position, and paravalvular leaks.
Trivial mild [] moderate LJ severe paravalvular leak was seen. The valve was felt to be in good position relative to
the annulus.

SHEATH REMOVAL AND ACCESS CLOSURE

The TAVR access sheath was then removed over a J-tipped guidewire, and hemostasis was achieved by advancing
the Perclose knot to the arteriotomy site.

Protamine was administered. The J-tipped guide wire was removed and an 8F Angioseal device was placed. The
knot for the Perclose devices was locked and the suture was cut at the arteriotomy site.

The alternative access (non-TAVR) site was closed with a 6F Angio-Seal vascular closure device after an angiogram
documented access in the CFA.

About SMART Health Cards

A SMART Health Card is a way to store and share your vaccination history and/or test results as a specially
formatted QR code. You share a SMART Health Card by letting someone scan the QR code on your paper or
phone screen with SMART Health Card Verifier (available free on Android and iPhone) or another compatible
app. SMART Health Cards are secure, portable, and easy for entities like airlines, governments, and venues to
verify. When scanned using an appropriate app, a verifier can easily see that the information on the card has
not been tampered with, making SMART Health Cards a safe and reliable way to demonstrate health status.
Different organizations have different rules and requirements for verifying vaccinations and test results, so
make sure an organization accepts SMART Health Cards before trying to use one.

You can learn more about SMART Health Cards here: https://smarthealth.cards/

Summary (continued

Heart Failure Discharge Instructions (continued)

Heart failure occurs when your heart does not pump as much blood as the body needs. Failure does not mean that the
heart has stopped pumping but rather that it is not pumping as well as it should. Over time, this causes fluid buildup in
your lungs and other parts of your body. Fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen ankles, and other
problems. Heart failure is treated with medicines, a heart-healthy lifestyle, and the steps you take to check your symptoms.
Treatment can slow the disease, help you feel better, and help keep you out of the hospital. Treatment may also help you
live longer.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?

=
‘

Q Medicines

* Be safe with medicines. Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you
think you are having a problem with your medicine.
You will get more details on the specific medicines your doctor prescribes. Medicines can
help your heart work better, help you feel better, and help keep you out of the hospital.
Medicines may also help you live longer.
Talk with your doctor or pharmacist before you take a new prescription or over-the-counter
medicine. Ask if the medicine is safe for you to take. Some medicines can affect your heart
and make heart failure worse. Others may keep your heart failure medicines from working
right. Over-the-counter medicines that you may need to avoid include herbal supplements,
vitamins, pain relievers called NSAIDs, antacids, laxatives, and cough, cold, flu, or sinus
medicine.

“ Diet

Eat heart-healthy foods. These foods include vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, lean meat, fish,
and whole grains.

Your doctor may suggest that you limit sodium. Your doctor can tell you how much sodium
is right for you. An example is less than 3,000 mg a day. This includes all the salt you eat in

cooking or in packaged foods. People get most of their sodium from processed foods. Fast
food and restaurant meals also tend to be very high in sodium
+ Limit your fluid intake if your doctor tells you to. Your doctor will tell you how much fluid
you can have in a day.
Symptoms
* Weigh yourself without clothing at the same time each day. Record your weight. Call your
doctor if you have a sudden weight gain, such as more than 2 to 3 pounds in a day or 5
pounds in a week. (Your doctor may suggest a different range of weight gain.) A sudden
weight gain may mean that your heart failure is getting worse.
* Check your symptoms every day to watch for changes. Know what to do if your symptoms
get worse.
Activity
* Be active. Do not start to exercise until you have talked with your doctor. Together you can
make an exercise program that is enjoyable and safe for you. Regular exercise can make
your heart and your body stronger. Being active can help you feel better too.
With your doctor, plan how often, how long, and how hard you will be active. Don't exercise

too hard because it can put stress on your heart.
If your doctor has not set you up with a cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) program, ask if it's

right for you. Cardiac rehab can give you education and support that help you stay as
healthy as possible.

When you exercise, watch for signs that your heart is working too hard. You are pushing
yourself too hard if you cannot talk while you are exercising. If you become short of breath
or dizzy or have chest pain, stop, sit down, and rest.

Heart-healthy lifestyle

* Do not smoke. Smoking can make a heart condition worse. If you need help quitting, talk to
your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances
of quitting for good. Quitting smoking may be the most important step you can take to
protect your heart.

Stay at a healthy weight. Lose weight if you need to.

Manage other health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

Limit or avoid alcohol. Ask your doctor how much alcohol, if any, is safe for you.

If you think you may have a problem with alcohol or drug use, talk to your doctor.

Avoid infections such as COVID-19, colds, and the flu. Get the flu vaccine every year. Get a
pneumococcal vaccine shot. If you have had one before, ask your doctor whether you need
another dose. Stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.

When should you call for help?

Call 911 if you have symptoms of sudden heart failure such as:

* You have severe trouble breathing.
* You cough up pink, foamy mucus.
* You have a new irregular or rapid heartbeat.

CARDIAC REHAB EDUCATION PACKET

What does cardiac rehab involve?
Cardiac rehabilitation doesn’t change your past, but it can help you improve your heart's
future.

Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program designed to improve your
cardiovascular health if you have experienced heart attack, heart failure, angioplasty,
stents or heart surgery. Cardiac rehab has three equally important parts:

1. Exercise counseling and training: Exercise gets your heart pumping and your
entire cardiovascular system working. You'll learn how to get your body moving
in ways that promote heart health.

2. Education for heart-healthy living: A key element of cardiac rehab is educating
yourself: How can you manage your risk factors? Quit smoking? Make heart-
healthy nutrition choices?

3. Counseling to reduce stress: Stress hurts your heart. This part of cardiac rehab
helps you identify and tackle everyday sources of stress.

RISK FACTORS:

+ What does the term Risk Factor mean? Something that increases risk or susceptibility

+ What is Coronary Artery Disease? Plaque builds up in your arteries faster than normal and reduces the blood flow to
the heart muscle.

+ What are your UN-MODIFIABLE Risk Factors (things that are out of your control)?
° Family History
° Age
° Male
° Female post menopause

+ What are your MODIFIABLE cardiac risk factors (things that are in your control)? (target goals are below)

¢ SMOKING (within the past 12 months)

Change can be difficult, but improving your diet and lifestyle is an important part of treating heart disease. Recent
research suggests that the overall diet is more important than a focus on specific foods. Moderation is the key.
When you begin cardiac rehab, you'll be able to schedule an appointment with the dietitian to develop an
individualized plan to meet your goals. Meanwhile, use these tips below to get started.

+ Eat more vegetables and fruits. Vegetables and fruits are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber. They are
generally low in calories and rich in dietary fiber. Aim for 2 cups of vegetables and 1 cup of fruit each day.
+ Choose:
+ Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits, without added salt, sauces or sugar.
+ Low-sodium or no salt added canned vegetables. (if fresh or frozen are not available)
+ Canned fruits packed in juice or water.

+ Choose whole grain breads and cereals. Whole grains are good sources of fiber and vitamins. They also provide
carbohydrates for energy. Aim for 5 to 7 Y2-cup servings a day.
+ Choose:
+ 100% whole wheat bread or whole grain with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice.
+ High fiber cereal with 3 or more grams of fiber per serving.
+ Brown rice and whole grain pasta.
+ Oatmeal
+ Whole grain crackers and light popcorn

+ Go lean with protein. Protein sources include chicken, fish, meats, milk and milk products, nuts, eggs and
dried beans like pintos, kidney beans, etc. We need 6 ounces of lean protein each day and 2 to 3 servings of
low-fat dairy products.

+ Choose:

Skim or 1% milk.

Fish/seafood — especially salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel or sardines. Shrimp and other shellfish in

moderation.

Skinless chicken or turkey.

Lean beef and pork.

Eggs and egg substitutes. Recommendations are to limit to 2 to 4 egg yolks a week.

Nuts. (Unsalted)

Lose the saltshaker. A diet high in sodium/salt can increase your blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease. Most
people get 3-4 times the recommended amount of sodium.
+ Choose:
+ Herbs and spices for seasoning; Look for salt-free seasoning blends.
+ Mrs. Dash products and other low-sodium seasoning
+ Reduced-sodium condiments.
+ No-sodium beef and chicken bouillon.

Preparation makes a difference.
+ Bake, broil, grill, steam or stir-fry foods. Avoid deep-fat fried foods and foods with added fats and sauces.
+ Add flavor with herbs and spices, lemon juice and salt-free seasonings such as Mrs. Dash or Herb-Ox No-Sodium
bouillon
+ Do NOT use a salt substitute until you talk with your doctor.

Choose fats wisely. Not all fats are the same. Monounsaturated fats like olive and canola oil and polyunsaturated fats
like corn oil and other vegetable oils are more heart healthy. All fats are high in calories.
+ Choose:
+ Olive and canola oils
+ Trans-fat free margarine.
+ Cooking spray
+ Low-fat mayo and salad dressings

Eating out. |f you eat out or order takeout meals several times a week, you need to choose carefully.
+ Plan ahead. Check out restaurant web sites for nutrition information.
+ Ask for low-fat, lighter fare entrees or heart healthy options.
+ At salad bars select raw veggies (lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, etc.) instead of marinated salads
and meat. Skip the cheese and bacon bits. Use a small amount of salad dressing.
+ Choose whole grain breads and crackers instead of biscuits.

Reading food labels. Food labels are a great tool to help you make heart healthy changes. Reading labels when
grocery shopping can be time consuming. Choose two or three items to look at each time you shop. Make a note of
the best products to meet your goals and add them to your grocery list.

+ Look first at the serving size. All information is based on the serving size.

+ Choose lower fat and lower sodium foods.

+ If you want to lose weight, compare the calories in similar foods.

+ If you have diabetes, look at the Total Carbohydrates before buying.

Maintain or achieve a healthy weight. Being overweight is a risk factor for heart disease. Losing 5 to 10 percent of
your current weight can have significant health benefits. The key is to eat less and move more.

+ Reduce your portion sizes and skip second helpings.

+ Pay attention to your hunger cues. Don't eat out of boredom or to relieve stress.

* Rethink your drink. Calories from sweet tea, regular sodas, specialty coffees and alcoholic drinks add up quickly.

Practice Moderation. A heart healthy diet is about balance. Allow yourself an indulgence occasionally. Don't let it turn
into an excuse for giving up on your heart healthy eating plan.

* Getting started. Think of the changes you need to make as a journey.

* Choose one or two changes you want to work on. Maybe you will switch from 2% milk to 1% milk and limit fried
foods to once a month. Perhaps you will work on eating more vegetables and drinking fewer sodas. In a couple of
weeks, try to make another change.

WHAT IS CARDIAC REHAB?

* Cardiac rehabilitation doesn't change your past, but it can help you improve your heart's future.

* Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program designed to improve your cardiovascular health if you have
experienced heart attack, heart failure, angioplasty, stent or heart surgery. Cardiac rehab has three equally
important parts:

1. Exercise counseling and training: Exercise gets your heart pumping and your entire cardiovascular system
working. You'll learn how to get your body moving in ways that promote heart health.

2. Education for heart-healthy living: A key element of cardiac rehab is educating yourself: How can you
manage your risk factors? Quit smoking? Make heart-healthy nutrition choices?

3. Counseling to reduce stress: Stress hurts your heart. This part of cardiac rehab helps you identify and tackle
everyday sources of stress.

+ Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Class Options: You will need to arrive 15 minutes prior to the class start time.

© 3 day per week class options: Monday, Wednesday & Friday

Developing a Pain Management Plan: After Your Visit

Your Care Instructions

Some diseases and injuries can cause pain that lasts a long time. You don't need to live with uncontrolled pain. A pain
management plan helps you find ways to control pain with side effects you can live with.

There are things you can do to help with pain. Only you know how much pain you feel. Constant pain can make you
depressed. It can cause stress and make it hard for you to eat and sleep. But there are ways to control the pain. They can
help you stay active, improve your mood, and heal faster.

Your plan can include many types of pain control. You may take prescription or over-the-counter drugs. You can also try
physical treatments and behavioral methods. Some medical treatments also help with pain. For example, radiation can be
used to reduce pain from bone cancer.

You and your doctor will work to make your plan. Be sure to read it often. Change it if your pain is not under control.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?
Physical treatments

+ Be safe with medicines. Take pain medicines exactly as directed.
° If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it exactly as prescribed. Recording the times you took
medicine may help you ensure medication is taken as prescribed.
° If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.
+ If your pain medicine causes side effects such as constipation or nausea, you may need to take other medicines for
those problems. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you have.

Behavioral treatments

* Biofeedback teaches you to control a body function that you normally don't think about. These are things like skin
temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. At first, you will use a machine to give you feedback on the function you
want to control. Then a therapist will teach you what to do next. Over time, you can stop using the machine.

+ Breathing techniques can help you relax and get rid of tension.

Guided imagery is a series of thoughts and images that can focus your attention away from your pain. When you do

it, you use all your senses to help your body respond as though what you are imagining is real.

Hypnosis is a state of focused concentration that makes you less aware of your surroundings. It may cause your brain

to release chemicals that relieve pain. You can have a therapist help you through hypnosis. Or you can learn to use it

‘on yourself.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of counseling. It helps you change your thought patterns. Changes in your

thoughts can help change your behavior and the way you perceive your body.

Summary (continued

+ In the hospital, you may have experienced some non-medicine comfort treatments such as: deep breathing,
positioning, repositioning, using blankets or pillows, or pillows to splint area of pain, using security objects, cool
cloth, decreasing distractions or lowering the lighting, family presence, minimizing unnecessary movement, music, or
verbalization. Play therapy, rocking, and swaddling, may help infants and children. Some of these may have worked
to control or lower your pain. These are treatments that you may use at home if they are helpful.

Other treatments and ideas

+ Aromatherapy uses the scent of oils obtained from plants to help you relax or to relieve stress.

+ Meditation focuses your attention to give a clear awareness of your life. You sit quietly, focus on one image or sound,

and breathe deeply.

Yoga uses stretching and exercises (called postures) to reduce stress and improve flexibility and health.

Keep track of your pain in a pain diary. This can help you understand how the things you do affect your pain.

+ Some hospitals have special pain clinics or centers. Your doctor may refer you to a pain clinic or center. Or you can
ask your doctor about them.

Learning About Opioids

Introduction

1 me |

Opioids are medicines used to relieve moderate to severe pain. They may be used for a short time for pain, such as after
surgery. Or in some cases a doctor might prescribe them for long-term pain. They don't cure a health problem. But they
may help you manage the pain and function better.

Sometimes opioids are used for people who can't take other pain medicines. They may be prescribed if you have certain
health problems. For instance, you may take an opioid instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Opioids are strong medicines. They can help you manage pain when you use them the right way. But they can cause
serious harm and even death.

If you decide to take opioids, here are some things to remember.

+ Keep your doctor informed. You can develop opioid use disorder. Moderate to severe opioid use disorder is
sometimes called addiction. The risk is higher if you have a history of substance use. Your doctor will monitor you
closely for signs of opioid use disorder and to figure out when you no longer need to take opioids.

Make a treatment plan. The goal of your plan is to be able to function and do the things you need to do, even if
you still have some pain. You might be able to manage your pain with other non-opioid options. These include
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical therapy, relaxation, non-opioid prescription pain medicine, and over-
the-counter pain medicines.

Be aware of the side effects. Opioids can cause side effects, such as constipation, sleepiness, and nausea. And over
time, you may need a higher dose to get pain relief. This is called tolerance. Your body also gets used to opioids. This
is called physical dependence. If you suddenly stop taking them, you may have withdrawal symptoms. Serious risks
of using opioids include overdose and death.

Examples

Opioids or other medicines that contain them include:

* Codeine (Tylenol 3).
* Hydrocodone (Norco).
* Oxycodone (Percocet).

Safety tips

If you need to take opioids to manage your pain, remember these safety tips.

+ Follow directions carefully. It's easy to misuse opioids if you take a dose other than what's prescribed by your
doctor. This can lead to accidental overdose and even death. Even sharing them with someone they weren't meant
for is misuse.

* Be cautious. Opioids may affect your judgment and decision making. Do not drive or operate machinery while you
take them. Talk with your doctor about when it is safe to drive.

+ Reduce the risk of drug interactions. Opioids can be dangerous if you take them with alcohol or with certain
drugs like sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. The combination can decrease your breathing rate and lead to
overdose or death. Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you take, including over-the-counter
medicines. Don't start any new medicines before you talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

* Safely store and dispose of opioids. Store opioids in a safe and secure place. Make sure that pets, children, friends,
and family can't get to them. When you're done using opioids, make sure to dispose of them safely and as quickly as
possible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends these disposal options.

° The best option is to take your medicine to a drop-off box or take-back program that is authorized by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

If these programs aren't available in your area and your medicine doesn't have specific disposal instructions
(such as flushing), you can throw them into your household trash if you follow the FDA's instructions. Visit
fda.gov and search for “unused medicine disposal."

° If you have opioid patches (used or unused), your options are to take them to a DEA-authorized site or flush
them down the toilet. Do not throw them in the trash.

¢ Only flush your medicine down the toilet if you can't get to a DEA-approved site or your medicine instructions
state clearly to flush them.

+ Reduce the risk of overdose. Opioids can be very dangerous. Protect yourself by asking your doctor about a
naloxone rescue kit. It can help you—and even save your life—if you take too much of an opioid

Who is most at risk?

Your risk rises if you misuse opioids, take high doses, have certain health problems, or if you've overdosed before. You're
also at higher risk if you use them with another substance, like alcohol, or take illegal opioids, or if you used them
regularly and then take them again after you'd cut back or stopped.

When should you call for help?

Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:

+ You have signs of an overdose. These include:
Slow, shallow, or stopped breathing.
¢ Pinpoint pupils.
Blue or purple lips or fingertips.
° No response when you ask questions, shake the person, or rub the person's breastbone with your knuckles.
° Seizures.
* You have symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. These may include:
° Sudden raised, red areas (hives) all over your body.
© Swelling of the throat, mouth, lips, or tongue.
° Trouble breathing.
° Passing out (losing consciousness). Or you may feel very lightheaded or suddenly feel weak, confused, or
restless.

About SMART Health Cards

A SMART Health Card is a way to store and share your vaccination history and/or test results as a specially
formatted QR code. You share a SMART Health Card by letting someone scan the QR code on your paper or
phone screen with SMART Health Card Verifier (available free on Android and iPhone) or another compatible
app. SMART Health Cards are secure, portable, and easy for entities like airlines, governments, and venues to
verify. When scanned using an appropriate app, a verifier can easily see that the information on the card has
not been tampered with, making SMART Health Cards a safe and reliable way to demonstrate health status.
Different organizations have different rules and requirements for verifying vaccinations and test results, so
make sure an organization accepts SMART Health Cards before trying to use one.

You can learn more about SMART Health Cards here: https://smarthealth.cards/
Get the free SMART Health Card Verifier app here: https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier

Heart Failure Discharge Instructions (continued)
s. ha ok’ tf ie i

Heart failure occurs when your heart does not pump as much blood as the body needs. Failure does not mean that the
heart has stopped pumping but rather that it is not pumping as well as it should. Over time, this causes fluid buildup in
your lungs and other parts of your body. Fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen ankles, and other
problems. Heart failure is treated with medicines, a heart-healthy lifestyle, and the steps you take to check your symptoms.
Treatment can slow the disease, help you feel better, and help keep you out of the hospital. Treatment may also help you
live longer.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?

BIRy

Medicines

* Be safe with medicines. Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you
think you are having a problem with your medicine.

* You will get more details on the specific medicines your doctor prescribes. Medicines can

help your heart work better, help you feel better, and help keep you out of the hospital.

Medicines may also help you live longer.

Talk with your doctor or pharmacist before you take a new prescription or over-the-counter

medicine. Ask if the medicine is safe for you to take. Some medicines can affect your heart

and make heart failure worse. Others may keep your heart failure medicines from working
right. Over-the-counter medicines that you may need to avoid include herbal supplements,
vitamins, pain relievers called NSAIDs, antacids, laxatives, and cough, cold, flu, or sinus
medicine.

+ Eat heart-healthy foods. These foods include vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, lean meat, fish,
and whole grains.

Your doctor may suggest that you limit sodium. Your doctor can tell you how much sodium
is right for you. An example is less than 3,000 mg a day. This includes all the salt you eat in

cooking or in packaged foods. People get most of their sodium from processed foods. Fast
food and restaurant meals also tend to be very high in sodium
* Limit your fluid intake if your doctor tells you to. Your doctor will tell you how much fluid
you can have in a day.
Symptoms
* Weigh yourself without clothing at the same time each day. Record your weight. Call your
doctor if you have a sudden weight gain, such as more than 2 to 3 pounds in a day or 5
pounds in a week. (Your doctor may suggest a different range of weight gain.) A sudden
weight gain may mean that your heart failure is getting worse.
* Check your symptoms every day to watch for changes. Know what to do if your symptoms
get worse.
Activity
* Be active. Do not start to exercise until you have talked with your doctor. Together you can
make an exercise program that is enjoyable and safe for you. Regular exercise can make
your heart and your body stronger. Being active can help you feel better too.
With your doctor, plan how often, how long, and how hard you will be active. Don't exercise

too hard because it can put stress on your heart.
If your doctor has not set you up with a cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) program, ask if it's

right for you. Cardiac rehab can give you education and support that help you stay as
healthy as possible.

When you exercise, watch for signs that your heart is working too hard. You are pushing
yourself too hard if you cannot talk while you are exercising. If you become short of breath
or dizzy or have chest pain, stop, sit down, and rest.

Heart-healthy lifestyle

* Do not smoke. Smoking can make a heart condition worse. If you need help quitting, talk to
your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances
of quitting for good. Quitting smoking may be the most important step you can take to
protect your heart.

Stay at a healthy weight. Lose weight if you need to.

Manage other health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

Limit or avoid alcohol. Ask your doctor how much alcohol, if any, is safe for you.

If you think you may have a problem with alcohol or drug use, talk to your doctor.

Avoid infections such as COVID-19, colds, and the flu. Get the flu vaccine every year. Get a
pneumococcal vaccine shot. If you have had one before, ask your doctor whether you need
another dose. Stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.

When should you call for help?

Call 911 if you have symptoms of sudden heart failure such as:

* You have severe trouble breathing.
* You cough up pink, foamy mucus.
* You have a new irregular or rapid heartbeat.

CARDIAC REHAB EDUCATION PACKET

What does cardiac rehab involve?
Cardiac rehabilitation doesn’t change your past, but it can help you improve your heart's
future.

Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program designed to improve your
cardiovascular health if you have experienced heart attack, heart failure, angioplasty,
stents or heart surgery. Cardiac rehab has three equally important parts:

1. Exercise counseling and training: Exercise gets your heart pumping and your
entire cardiovascular system working. You'll learn how to get your body moving
in ways that promote heart health.

2. Education for heart-healthy living: A key element of cardiac rehab is educating
yourself: How can you manage your risk factors? Quit smoking? Make heart-
healthy nutrition choices?

3. Counseling to reduce stress: Stress hurts your heart. This part of cardiac rehab
helps you identify and tackle everyday sources of stress.

RISK FACTORS:

+ What does the term Risk Factor mean? Something that increases risk or susceptibility

+ What is Coronary Artery Disease? Plaque builds up in your arteries faster than normal and reduces the blood flow to
the heart muscle.

+ What are your UN-MODIFIABLE Risk Factors (things that are out of your control)?
° Family History
° Age
° Male
° Female post menopause

+ What are your MODIFIABLE cardiac risk factors (things that are in your control)? (target goals are below)

¢ SMOKING (within the past 12 months)

Change can be difficult, but improving your diet and lifestyle is an important part of treating heart disease. Recent
research suggests that the overall diet is more important than a focus on specific foods. Moderation is the key.
When you begin cardiac rehab, you'll be able to schedule an appointment with the dietitian to develop an
individualized plan to meet your goals. Meanwhile, use these tips below to get started.

+ Eat more vegetables and fruits. Vegetables and fruits are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber. They are
generally low in calories and rich in dietary fiber. Aim for 2 cups of vegetables and 1 cup of fruit each day.
+ Choose:
+ Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits, without added salt, sauces or sugar.
+ Low-sodium or no salt added canned vegetables. (if fresh or frozen are not available)
+ Canned fruits packed in juice or water.

+ Choose whole grain breads and cereals. Whole grains are good sources of fiber and vitamins. They also provide
carbohydrates for energy. Aim for 5 to 7 ¥2-cup servings a day.
+ Choose:
+ 100% whole wheat bread or whole grain with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice.
+ High fiber cereal with 3 or more grams of fiber per serving.
+ Brown rice and whole grain pasta.
+ Oatmeal
+ Whole grain crackers and light popcorn

+ Go lean with protein. Protein sources include chicken, fish, meats, milk and milk products, nuts, eggs and
dried beans like pintos, kidney beans, etc. We need 6 ounces of lean protein each day and 2 to 3 servings of
low-fat dairy products.

+ Choose:
+ Skim or 1% milk.

Fish/seafood — especially salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel or sardines. Shrimp and other shellfish in

moderation.

Skinless chicken or turkey.

Instructions (continued)

Lose the saltshaker. A diet high in sodium/salt can increase your blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease. Most
people get 3-4 times the recommended amount of sodium.
+ Choose:
+ Herbs and spices for seasoning; Look for salt-free seasoning blends.
+ Mrs. Dash products and other low-sodium seasoning
+ Reduced-sodium condiments.
+ No-sodium beef and chicken bouillon.

Preparation makes a difference.
+ Bake, broil, grill, steam or stir-fry foods. Avoid deep-fat fried foods and foods with added fats and sauces.
+ Add flavor with herbs and spices, lemon juice and salt-free seasonings such as Mrs. Dash or Herb-Ox No-Sodium
bouillon
+ Do NOT use a salt substitute until you talk with your doctor.

Choose fats wisely. Not all fats are the same. Monounsaturated fats like olive and canola oil and polyunsaturated fats
like corn oil and other vegetable oils are more heart healthy. All fats are high in calories.
+ Choose:
+ Olive and canola oils
+ Trans-fat free margarine.
+ Cooking spray
+ Low-fat mayo and salad dressings

Eating out. |f you eat out or order takeout meals several times a week, you need to choose carefully.
+ Plan ahead. Check out restaurant web sites for nutrition information.
+ Ask for low-fat, lighter fare entrees or heart healthy options.
+ At salad bars select raw veggies (lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, etc.) instead of marinated salads
and meat. Skip the cheese and bacon bits. Use a small amount of salad dressing.
+ Choose whole grain breads and crackers instead of biscuits.

Reading food labels. Food labels are a great tool to help you make heart healthy changes. Reading labels when
grocery shopping can be time consuming. Choose two or three items to look at each time you shop. Make a note of
the best products to meet your goals and add them to your grocery list.

+ Look first at the serving size. All information is based on the serving size.

+ Choose lower fat and lower sodium foods.

+ If you want to lose weight, compare the calories in similar foods.

+ If you have diabetes, look at the Total Carbohydrates before buying.

Maintain or achieve a healthy weight. Being overweight is a risk factor for heart disease. Losing 5 to 10 percent of
your current weight can have significant health benefits. The key is to eat less and move more.

+ Reduce your portion sizes and skip second helpings.

+ Pay attention to your hunger cues. Don't eat out of boredom or to relieve stress.

* Rethink your drink. Calories from sweet tea, regular sodas, specialty coffees and alcoholic drinks add up quickly.

Practice Moderation. A heart healthy diet is about balance. Allow yourself an indulgence occasionally. Don't let it turn
into an excuse for giving up on your heart healthy eating plan.

* Getting started. Think of the changes you need to make as a journey.

* Choose one or two changes you want to work on. Maybe you will switch from 2% milk to 1% milk and limit fried
foods to once a month. Perhaps you will work on eating more vegetables and drinking fewer sodas. In a couple of
weeks, try to make another change.

+ Keep a food diary. Record everything you eat including the measured amounts. You can use paper and pencil, or a
phone app such as “My Fitness Pal.”

WHAT IS CARDIAC REHAB?

* Cardiac rehabilitation doesn't change your past, but it can help you improve your heart's future.

* Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program designed to improve your cardiovascular health if you have
experienced heart attack, heart failure, angioplasty, stent or heart surgery. Cardiac rehab has three equally
important parts:

1. Exercise counseling and training: Exercise gets your heart pumping and your entire cardiovascular system
working. You'll learn how to get your body moving in ways that promote heart health.

2. Education for heart-healthy living: A key element of cardiac rehab is educating yourself: How can you
manage your risk factors? Quit smoking? Make heart-healthy nutrition choices?

3. Counseling to reduce stress: Stress hurts your heart. This part of cardiac rehab helps you identify and tackle
everyday sources of stress.

« Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Class Options: You will need to arrive 15 minutes prior to the class start time.

° 3 day per week class options: Monday, Wednesday & Friday
7:30 AM - 8:15 AM 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM 10:30 AM - 11:15 AM 12:00 PM - 12:45 PM

Developing a Pain Management Plan: After Your Visit

Your Care Instructions

Some diseases and injuries can cause pain that lasts a long time. You don't need to live with uncontrolled pain. A pain
management plan helps you find ways to control pain with side effects you can live with.

There are things you can do to help with pain. Only you know how much pain you feel. Constant pain can make you
depressed. It can cause stress and make it hard for you to eat and sleep. But there are ways to control the pain. They can
help you stay active, improve your mood, and heal faster.

Your plan can include many types of pain control. You may take prescription or over-the-counter drugs. You can also try
physical treatments and behavioral methods. Some medical treatments also help with pain. For example, radiation can be
used to reduce pain from bone cancer.

You and your doctor will work to make your plan. Be sure to read it often. Change it if your pain is not under control.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?
Physical treatments

+ Be safe with medicines. Take pain medicines exactly as directed.
e If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it exactly as prescribed. Recording the times you took
medicine may help you ensure medication is taken as prescribed.
© If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.
+ If your pain medicine causes side effects such as constipation or nausea, you may need to take other medicines for
those problems. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you have.

Behavioral treatments

+ Biofeedback teaches you to control a body function that you normally don't think about. These are things like skin
temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. At first, you will use a machine to give you feedback on the function you
want to control. Then a therapist will teach you what to do next. Over time, you can stop using the machine.

+ Breathing techniques can help you relax and get rid of tension.

Guided imagery is a series of thoughts and images that can focus your attention away from your pain. When you do

it, you use all your senses to help your body respond as though what you are imagining is real.

Hypnosis is a state of focused concentration that makes you less aware of your surroundings. It may cause your brain

to release chemicals that relieve pain. You can have a therapist help you through hypnosis. Or you can learn to use it

‘on yourself.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of counseling. It helps you change your thought patterns. Changes in your

thoughts can help change your behavior and the way you perceive your body.

+ In the hospital, you may have experienced some non-medicine comfort treatments such as: deep breathing,
positioning, repositioning, using blankets or pillows, or pillows to splint area of pain, using security objects, cool
cloth, decreasing distractions or lowering the lighting, family presence, minimizing unnecessary movement, music, or
verbalization. Play therapy, rocking, and swaddling, may help infants and children. Some of these may have worked
to control or lower your pain. These are treatments that you may use at home if they are helpful.

Other treatments and ideas

+ Aromatherapy uses the scent of oils obtained from plants to help you relax or to relieve stress.

+ Meditation focuses your attention to give a clear awareness of your life. You sit quietly, focus on one image or sound,

and breathe deeply.

Yoga uses stretching and exercises (called postures) to reduce stress and improve flexibility and health.

Keep track of your pain in a pain diary. This can help you understand how the things you do affect your pain.

+ Some hospitals have special pain clinics or centers. Your doctor may refer you to a pain clinic or center. Or you can
ask your doctor about them.

Learning About Opioids

Introduction

Opioids are medicines used to relieve moderate to severe pain. They may be used for a short time for pain, such as after
surgery. Or in some cases a doctor might prescribe them for long-term pain. They don't cure a health problem. But they
may help you manage the pain and function better.

Sometimes opioids are used for people who can't take other pain medicines. They may be prescribed if you have certain
health problems. For instance, you may take an opioid instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Opioids are strong medicines. They can help you manage pain when you use them the right way. But they can cause
serious harm and even death.

If you decide to take opioids, here are some things to remember.

+ Keep your doctor informed. You can develop opioid use disorder. Moderate to severe opioid use disorder is
sometimes called addiction. The risk is higher if you have a history of substance use. Your doctor will monitor you
closely for signs of opioid use disorder and to figure out when you no longer need to take opioids.

Make a treatment plan. The goal of your plan is to be able to function and do the things you need to do, even if
you still have some pain. You might be able to manage your pain with other non-opioid options. These include

cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical therapy, relaxation, non-opioid prescription pain medicine, and over-
the-counter pain medicines.

Be aware of the side effects. Opioids can cause side effects, such as constipation, sleepiness, and nausea. And over
time, you may need a higher dose to get pain relief. This is called tolerance. Your body also gets used to opioids. This

is called physical dependence. If you suddenly stop taking them, you may have withdrawal symptoms. Serious risks
of using opioids include overdose and death.

Examples

Opioids or other medicines that contain them include:

* Codeine (Tylenol 3).
* Hydrocodone (Norco).
* Oxycodone (Percocet).

Safety tips

If you need to take opioids to manage your pain, remember these safety tips.

+ Follow directions carefully. It's easy to misuse opioids if you take a dose other than what's prescribed by your
doctor. This can lead to accidental overdose and even death. Even sharing them with someone they weren't meant
for is misuse.

* Be cautious. Opioids may affect your judgment and decision making. Do not drive or operate machinery while you
take them. Talk with your doctor about when it is safe to drive.

+ Reduce the risk of drug interactions. Opioids can be dangerous if you take them with alcohol or with certain
drugs like sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. The combination can decrease your breathing rate and lead to
overdose or death. Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you take, including over-the-counter
medicines. Don't start any new medicines before you talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

* Safely store and dispose of opioids. Store opioids in a safe and secure place. Make sure that pets, children, friends,
and family can't get to them. When you're done using opioids, make sure to dispose of them safely and as quickly as
possible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends these disposal options.

© The best option is to take your medicine to a drop-off box or take-back program that is authorized by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

If these programs aren't available in your area and your medicine doesn't have specific disposal instructions
(such as flushing), you can throw them into your household trash if you follow the FDA's instructions. Visit
fda.gov and search for “unused medicine disposal.”

° If you have opioid patches (used or unused), your options are to take them to a DEA-authorized site or flush
them down the toilet. Do not throw them in the trash.

¢ Only flush your medicine down the toilet if you can't get to a DEA-approved site or your medicine instructions
state clearly to flush them.

* Reduce the risk of overdose. Opioids can be very dangerous. Protect yourself by asking your doctor about a
naloxone rescue kit. It can help you—and even save your life—if you take too much of an opioid

Who is most at risk?

Your risk rises if you misuse opioids, take high doses, have certain health problems, or if you've overdosed before. You're
also at higher risk if you use them with another substance, like alcohol, or take illegal opioids, or if you used them
regularly and then take them again after you'd cut back or stopped.

When should you call for help?

Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:

+ You have signs of an overdose. These include:
Slow, shallow, or stopped breathing.
¢ Pinpoint pupils.
¢ Blue or purple lips or fingertips.
° No response when you ask questions, shake the person, or rub the person's breastbone with your knuckles.
° Seizures.
* You have symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. These may include:
° Sudden raised, red areas (hives) all over your body.
© Swelling of the throat, mouth, lips, or tongue.
° Trouble breathing.
© Passing out (losing consciousness). Or you may feel very lightheaded or suddenly feel weak, confused, or
restless.

About SMART Health Cards

A SMART Health Card is a way to store and share your vaccination history and/or test results as a specially
formatted QR code. You share a SMART Health Card by letting someone scan the QR code on your paper or
phone screen with SMART Health Card Verifier (available free on Android and iPhone) or another compatible
app. SMART Health Cards are secure, portable, and easy for entities like airlines, governments, and venues to
verify. When scanned using an appropriate app, a verifier can easily see that the information on the card has
not been tampered with, making SMART Health Cards a safe and reliable way to demonstrate health status.
Different organizations have different rules and requirements for verifying vaccinations and test results, so
make sure an organization accepts SMART Health Cards before trying to use one.

You can learn more about SMART Health Cards here: https://smarthealth.cards/

Heart Failure Discharge Instructions (continued)
s. ha ok’ tf ie i

Heart failure occurs when your heart does not pump as much blood as the body needs. Failure does not mean that the
heart has stopped pumping but rather that it is not pumping as well as it should. Over time, this causes fluid buildup in
your lungs and other parts of your body. Fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen ankles, and other
problems. Heart failure is treated with medicines, a heart-healthy lifestyle, and the steps you take to check your symptoms.
Treatment can slow the disease, help you feel better, and help keep you out of the hospital. Treatment may also help you
live longer.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?

BIRy

Medicines

* Be safe with medicines. Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you
think you are having a problem with your medicine.

* You will get more details on the specific medicines your doctor prescribes. Medicines can

help your heart work better, help you feel better, and help keep you out of the hospital.

Medicines may also help you live longer.

Talk with your doctor or pharmacist before you take a new prescription or over-the-counter

medicine. Ask if the medicine is safe for you to take. Some medicines can affect your heart

and make heart failure worse. Others may keep your heart failure medicines from working
right. Over-the-counter medicines that you may need to avoid include herbal supplements,
vitamins, pain relievers called NSAIDs, antacids, laxatives, and cough, cold, flu, or sinus
medicine.

+ Eat heart-healthy foods. These foods include vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, lean meat, fish,
and whole grains.

Your doctor may suggest that you limit sodium. Your doctor can tell you how much sodium
is right for you. An example is less than 3,000 mg a day. This includes all the salt you eat in

cooking or in packaged foods. People get most of their sodium from processed foods. Fast
food and restaurant meals also tend to be very high in sodium
+ Limit your fluid intake if your doctor tells you to. Your doctor will tell you how much fluid
you can have in a day.
Symptoms
* Weigh yourself without clothing at the same time each day. Record your weight. Call your
doctor if you have a sudden weight gain, such as more than 2 to 3 pounds in a day or 5
pounds in a week. (Your doctor may suggest a different range of weight gain.) A sudden
weight gain may mean that your heart failure is getting worse.
* Check your symptoms every day to watch for changes. Know what to do if your symptoms
get worse.
Activity
* Be active. Do not start to exercise until you have talked with your doctor. Together you can
make an exercise program that is enjoyable and safe for you. Regular exercise can make
your heart and your body stronger. Being active can help you feel better too.
With your doctor, plan how often, how long, and how hard you will be active. Don't exercise

too hard because it can put stress on your heart.
If your doctor has not set you up with a cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) program, ask if it's

right for you. Cardiac rehab can give you education and support that help you stay as
healthy as possible.

When you exercise, watch for signs that your heart is working too hard. You are pushing
yourself too hard if you cannot talk while you are exercising. If you become short of breath
or dizzy or have chest pain, stop, sit down, and rest.

Heart-healthy lifestyle

* Do not smoke. Smoking can make a heart condition worse. If you need help quitting, talk to
your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances
of quitting for good. Quitting smoking may be the most important step you can take to
protect your heart.

Stay at a healthy weight. Lose weight if you need to.

Manage other health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

Limit or avoid alcohol. Ask your doctor how much alcohol, if any, is safe for you.

If you think you may have a problem with alcohol or drug use, talk to your doctor.

Avoid infections such as COVID-19, colds, and the flu. Get the flu vaccine every year. Get a
pneumococcal vaccine shot. If you have had one before, ask your doctor whether you need
another dose. Stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.

When should you call for help?

Call 911 if you have symptoms of sudden heart failure such as:

* You have severe trouble breathing.
* You cough up pink, foamy mucus.
* You have a new irregular or rapid heartbeat.

CARDIAC REHAB EDUCATION PACKET

What does cardiac rehab involve?
Cardiac rehabilitation doesn’t change your past, but it can help you improve your heart's
future.

Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program designed to improve your
cardiovascular health if you have experienced heart attack, heart failure, angioplasty,
stents or heart surgery. Cardiac rehab has three equally important parts:

1. Exercise counseling and training: Exercise gets your heart pumping and your
entire cardiovascular system working. You'll learn how to get your body moving
in ways that promote heart health.

2. Education for heart-healthy living: A key element of cardiac rehab is educating
yourself: How can you manage your risk factors? Quit smoking? Make heart-
healthy nutrition choices?

3. Counseling to reduce stress: Stress hurts your heart. This part of cardiac rehab
helps you identify and tackle everyday sources of stress.

RISK FACTORS:

+ What does the term Risk Factor mean? Something that increases risk or susceptibility

+ What is Coronary Artery Disease? Plaque builds up in your arteries faster than normal and reduces the blood flow to
the heart muscle.

+ What are your UN-MODIFIABLE Risk Factors (things that are out of your control)?
° Family History
° Age
° Male
° Female post menopause

+ What are your MODIFIABLE cardiac risk factors (things that are in your control)? (target goals are below)

¢ SMOKING (within the past 12 months)

Change can be difficult, but improving your diet and lifestyle is an important part of treating heart disease. Recent
research suggests that the overall diet is more important than a focus on specific foods. Moderation is the key.
When you begin cardiac rehab, you'll be able to schedule an appointment with the dietitian to develop an
individualized plan to meet your goals. Meanwhile, use these tips below to get started.

+ Eat more vegetables and fruits. Vegetables and fruits are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber. They are
generally low in calories and rich in dietary fiber. Aim for 2 cups of vegetables and 1 cup of fruit each day.
+ Choose:
+ Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits, without added salt, sauces or sugar.
+ Low-sodium or no salt added canned vegetables. (if fresh or frozen are not available)
+ Canned fruits packed in juice or water.

+ Choose whole grain breads and cereals. Whole grains are good sources of fiber and vitamins. They also provide
carbohydrates for energy. Aim for 5 to 7 Y2-cup servings a day.
+ Choose:
+ 100% whole wheat bread or whole grain with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice.
+ High fiber cereal with 3 or more grams of fiber per serving.
+ Brown rice and whole grain pasta.
+ Oatmeal
+ Whole grain crackers and light popcorn

+ Go lean with protein. Protein sources include chicken, fish, meats, milk and milk products, nuts, eggs and
dried beans like pintos, kidney beans, etc. We need 6 ounces of lean protein each day and 2 to 3 servings of
low-fat dairy products.

+ Choose:
+ Skim or 1% milk.

Fish/seafood — especially salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel or sardines. Shrimp and other shellfish in

moderation.

Skinless chicken or turkey.

Lean beef and pork.

Eggs and egg substitutes. Recommendations are to limit to 2 to 4 egg yolks a week.

Nuts. (Unsalted)

Instructions (continued)

Lose the saltshaker. A diet high in sodium/salt can increase your blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease. Most
people get 3-4 times the recommended amount of sodium.
+ Choose:
+ Herbs and spices for seasoning; Look for salt-free seasoning blends.
+ Mrs. Dash products and other low-sodium seasoning
+ Reduced-sodium condiments.
+ No-sodium beef and chicken bouillon.

Preparation makes a difference.
+ Bake, broil, grill, steam or stir-fry foods. Avoid deep-fat fried foods and foods with added fats and sauces.
+ Add flavor with herbs and spices, lemon juice and salt-free seasonings such as Mrs. Dash or Herb-Ox No-Sodium
bouillon
+ Do NOT use a salt substitute until you talk with your doctor.

Choose fats wisely. Not all fats are the same. Monounsaturated fats like olive and canola oil and polyunsaturated fats
like corn oil and other vegetable oils are more heart healthy. All fats are high in calories.
+ Choose:
+ Olive and canola oils
+ Trans-fat free margarine.
+ Cooking spray
+ Low-fat mayo and salad dressings

Eating out. |f you eat out or order takeout meals several times a week, you need to choose carefully.
+ Plan ahead. Check out restaurant web sites for nutrition information.
+ Ask for low-fat, lighter fare entrees or heart healthy options.
+ At salad bars select raw veggies (lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, etc.) instead of marinated salads
and meat. Skip the cheese and bacon bits. Use a small amount of salad dressing.
+ Choose whole grain breads and crackers instead of biscuits.

Reading food labels. Food labels are a great tool to help you make heart healthy changes. Reading labels when
grocery shopping can be time consuming. Choose two or three items to look at each time you shop. Make a note of
the best products to meet your goals and add them to your grocery list.

+ Look first at the serving size. All information is based on the serving size.

+ Choose lower fat and lower sodium foods.

+ If you want to lose weight, compare the calories in similar foods.

+ If you have diabetes, look at the Total Carbohydrates before buying.

Maintain or achieve a healthy weight. Being overweight is a risk factor for heart disease. Losing 5 to 10 percent of
your current weight can have significant health benefits. The key is to eat less and move more.

+ Reduce your portion sizes and skip second helpings.

+ Pay attention to your hunger cues. Don't eat out of boredom or to relieve stress.

* Rethink your drink. Calories from sweet tea, regular sodas, specialty coffees and alcoholic drinks add up quickly.

Practice Moderation. A heart healthy diet is about balance. Allow yourself an indulgence occasionally. Don't let it turn
into an excuse for giving up on your heart healthy eating plan.

* Choose one or two changes you want to work on. Maybe you will switch from 2% milk to 1% milk and limit fried
foods to once a month. Perhaps you will work on eating more vegetables and drinking fewer sodas. In a couple of
weeks, try to make another change.

Developing a Pain Management Plan: After Your Visit

Your Care Instructions

Some diseases and injuries can cause pain that lasts a long time. You don't need to live with uncontrolled pain. A pain
management plan helps you find ways to control pain with side effects you can live with.

There are things you can do to help with pain. Only you know how much pain you feel. Constant pain can make you
depressed. It can cause stress and make it hard for you to eat and sleep. But there are ways to control the pain. They can
help you stay active, improve your mood, and heal faster.

Your plan can include many types of pain control. You may take prescription or over-the-counter drugs. You can also try
physical treatments and behavioral methods. Some medical treatments also help with pain. For example, radiation can be
used to reduce pain from bone cancer.

You and your doctor will work to make your plan. Be sure to read it often. Change it if your pain is not under control.

Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your
doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

How can you care for yourself at home?
Physical treatments

+ Be safe with medicines. Take pain medicines exactly as directed.
° If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it exactly as prescribed. Recording the times you took
medicine may help you ensure medication is taken as prescribed.
° If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.
+ If your pain medicine causes side effects such as constipation or nausea, you may need to take other medicines for
those problems. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you have.

Behavioral treatments

* Biofeedback teaches you to control a body function that you normally don't think about. These are things like skin
temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. At first, you will use a machine to give you feedback on the function you
want to control. Then a therapist will teach you what to do next. Over time, you can stop using the machine.

+ Breathing techniques can help you relax and get rid of tension.

Guided imagery is a series of thoughts and images that can focus your attention away from your pain. When you do

it, you use all your senses to help your body respond as though what you are imagining is real.

Hypnosis is a state of focused concentration that makes you less aware of your surroundings. It may cause your brain

to release chemicals that relieve pain. You can have a therapist help you through hypnosis. Or you can learn to use it

‘on yourself.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of counseling. It helps you change your thought patterns. Changes in your

thoughts can help change your behavior and the way you perceive your body.

+ In the hospital, you may have experienced some non-medicine comfort treatments such as: deep breathing,
positioning, repositioning, using blankets or pillows, or pillows to splint area of pain, using security objects, cool
cloth, decreasing distractions or lowering the lighting, family presence, minimizing unnecessary movement, music, or
verbalization. Play therapy, rocking, and swaddling, may help infants and children. Some of these may have worked
to control or lower your pain. These are treatments that you may use at home if they are helpful.

Other treatments and ideas

+ Aromatherapy uses the scent of oils obtained from plants to help you relax or to relieve stress.

+ Meditation focuses your attention to give a clear awareness of your life. You sit quietly, focus on one image or sound,

and breathe deeply.

Yoga uses stretching and exercises (called postures) to reduce stress and improve flexibility and health.

Keep track of your pain in a pain diary. This can help you understand how the things you do affect your pain.

+ Some hospitals have special pain clinics or centers. Your doctor may refer you to a pain clinic or center. Or you can
ask your doctor about them.

Learning About Opioids

Introduction

Opioids are medicines used to relieve moderate to severe pain. They may be used for a short time for pain, such as after
surgery. Or in some cases a doctor might prescribe them for long-term pain. They don't cure a health problem. But they
may help you manage the pain and function better.

Sometimes opioids are used for people who can't take other pain medicines. They may be prescribed if you have certain
health problems. For instance, you may take an opioid instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Opioids are strong medicines. They can help you manage pain when you use them the right way. But they can cause
serious harm and even death.

If you decide to take opioids, here are some things to remember.

+ Keep your doctor informed. You can develop opioid use disorder. Moderate to severe opioid use disorder is
sometimes called addiction. The risk is higher if you have a history of substance use. Your doctor will monitor you
closely for signs of opioid use disorder and to figure out when you no longer need to take opioids.

Make a treatment plan. The goal of your plan is to be able to function and do the things you need to do, even if
you still have some pain. You might be able to manage your pain with other non-opioid options. These include
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical therapy, relaxation, non-opioid prescription pain medicine, and over-
the-counter pain medicines.

Be aware of the side effects. Opioids can cause side effects, such as constipation, sleepiness, and nausea. And over
time, you may need a higher dose to get pain relief. This is called tolerance. Your body also gets used to opioids. This
is called physical dependence. If you suddenly stop taking them, you may have withdrawal symptoms. Serious risks
of using opioids include overdose and death.

Examples

Opioids or other medicines that contain them include:

* Codeine (Tylenol 3).
* Hydrocodone (Norco).
* Oxycodone (Percocet).

Safety tips

If you need to take opioids to manage your pain, remember these safety tips.

+ Follow directions carefully. It's easy to misuse opioids if you take a dose other than what's prescribed by your
doctor. This can lead to accidental overdose and even death. Even sharing them with someone they weren't meant
for is misuse.

* Be cautious. Opioids may affect your judgment and decision making. Do not drive or operate machinery while you
take them. Talk with your doctor about when it is safe to drive.

+ Reduce the risk of drug interactions. Opioids can be dangerous if you take them with alcohol or with certain
drugs like sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. The combination can decrease your breathing rate and lead to
overdose or death. Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you take, including over-the-counter
medicines. Don't start any new medicines before you talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

* Safely store and dispose of opioids. Store opioids in a safe and secure place. Make sure that pets, children, friends,
and family can't get to them. When you're done using opioids, make sure to dispose of them safely and as quickly as
possible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends these disposal options.

° The best option is to take your medicine to a drop-off box or take-back program that is authorized by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

If these programs aren't available in your area and your medicine doesn't have specific disposal instructions
(such as flushing), you can throw them into your household trash if you follow the FDA's instructions. Visit
fda.gov and search for “unused medicine disposal."

° If you have opioid patches (used or unused), your options are to take them to a DEA-authorized site or flush
them down the toilet. Do not throw them in the trash.

¢ Only flush your medicine down the toilet if you can't get to a DEA-approved site or your medicine instructions
state clearly to flush them.

+ Reduce the risk of overdose. Opioids can be very dangerous. Protect yourself by asking your doctor about a
naloxone rescue kit. It can help you—and even save your life—if you take too much of an opioid

Who is most at risk?

Your risk rises if you misuse opioids, take high doses, have certain health problems, or if you've overdosed before. You're
also at higher risk if you use them with another substance, like alcohol, or take illegal opioids, or if you used them
regularly and then take them again after you'd cut back or stopped.

When should you call for help?

Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:

+ You have signs of an overdose. These include:
Slow, shallow, or stopped breathing.
¢ Pinpoint pupils.
Blue or purple lips or fingertips.
° No response when you ask questions, shake the person, or rub the person's breastbone with your knuckles.
° Seizures.
* You have symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. These may include:
° Sudden raised, red areas (hives) all over your body.
© Swelling of the throat, mouth, lips, or tongue.
° Trouble breathing.
° Passing out (losing consciousness). Or you may feel very lightheaded or suddenly feel weak, confused, or
restless.

gradient 7mmHg, VTI ratio 0.65

Severe pulmonary hypertension. The calculated RVSP is 79 mmHg, assuming a CVP of 3 mmHg.
The IVC is normal in size with greater than 50% collapse with inspiration suggestive of mean RAP of
3. mmHg.

There is no significant pericardial effusion.

Compared to pre-TAVR images from 8/29/23 study, mean aortic valve gradient has significantly
improved to 7 mmHg from

60mmHg prior. Compared to prior 6/19/2023 study, status post TAVR now.

HPI

Mr. Kitchen is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2; EtOH abuse with hepatic cirrhosis and
esophageal varices; history of GI bleeding with AVMs in 2019; GERD; chronic HFpEF; severe stage D1 aortic
stenosis.

On August 30, 2023 patient underwent TAVR procedure with a 29 mm Medtronic evolut FX via right transfemoral
approach with a post implantation dilation of the catheter heart valve with a 23 x 4 Z-Med balloon. Postop day 1
transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal biventricular function, with a mean gradient of 7 mmHg and trace
perivalvular leak. Patient does have severe pulmonary hypertension noted with an RVSP of 79 mmHg.

Patient followed up on September 11, 2023. At that time he reported that he was doing quite well. He reported
improvement in his breathing. He had no other complaints. Patient was not interested in cardiac rehab.

Patient presents to the office today and states that he is doing much better. He is no longer having shortness of
breath. He occasionally feels fatigued at times but that is seldom in comparison to how he felt before. His blood
pressure is 130/60 today. Last hemoglobin check was at discharge and was 9.2.

He presents today for follow-up and reports

Clinical Notes (continued)
77-year-old male with a history of alcohol induced cirrhosis/esophageal varices, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and
severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. He underwent a TF TAVR using a 29 mm EVOLUT FX prosthesis approximately
9 months ago. He states that he is extremely pleased with his progress. He denies any substernal chest discomfort
or dyspnea on exertion. Unfortunately, he is still drinking alcohol although he has reduced his intake considerably.

He is accompanied by his grandson who corroborates the findings. He was previously discharged on clopidogrel but
discontinued this after 3 months. He denies any bleeding from his esophageal varices for over 3 years.
